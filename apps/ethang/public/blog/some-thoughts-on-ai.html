      <h1>Some Thoughts On The Way Things Are</h1>

      <p>
        The following are a lot of thoughts that have been swirling in my head
        for a while. I have never been more afraid to speak my mind on a topic.
        Something about how sure people seem of themselves regarding AI. But
        it’s odd to me that no one can clearly state the benefits other than
        money. Everything is so cryptic, the benefits are so clearly horrid
        attempts at describing what a revolution this is. People have gotten so
        aggressive about this that those with a healthy level of skepticism, I
        feel, are increasingly afraid to speak their minds. For my own
        protection, I asked Google Gemini to "analyze this in one paragraph."
        This is what is said:
      </p>

      <div class="quote-box">
        <p>
          The provided text argues that modern society, driven by a constant
          need for "cheap dopamine hits," has lost its ability to engage with
          subtle and contemplative experiences, as exemplified by the
          intentional stillness in Studio Ghibli films like "Ma" (as discussed
          in the linked video). This addiction to rapid consumption extends to
          the software industry, where a focus on quick gains and "vibe coding"
          over true craftsmanship and engineering has led to a decline in
          quality and a pervasive culture of prioritizing easy money and job
          hopping over genuine skill and accountability. The author contends
          that this societal shift, fueled by a desire for continuous
          entertainment and a disregard for purpose and quality, has made
          individuals and industries alike susceptible to superficial solutions
          like LLMs, which are merely tools being overhyped by those who profit
          from them, ultimately leading to a less fulfilling and less effective
          world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="bold-breakpoint">And now, to something very human.</p>

      <p>
        Remember Studio Ghibli films? If you haven’t seen them, you should.
        Watch this quick 5-minute breakdown on "Ma," where moments of stillness
        and silence are intentionally included to allow the audience to reflect
        and connect more deeply with the narrative and characters. It is rare
        that we have moments of pace and contemplation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghibli films always hold a gentle, calm vibe. One that can grab and keep
        your attention. They don’t need constant action to keep your mind busy
        and your eyeballs on the screen. Compare that to the action-packed
        Avengers or modern Star Wars movies. We can’t even watch these without
        scrolling social media on our phones at the same time. We are undeniably
        and objectively addicted to cheap dopamine hits as a society. Legal
        crack has spread across the world and won. There's not really a way out.
        This is who we are now. Screen-addicted shells clamoring for faster
        pacing and more content.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not just talking about phone and screen addiction either. But there
        is something deeply wrong. The fact that most people can’t sit, watch,
        and be engrossed in the subtle and masterful details of a Studio Ghibli
        film without checking Twitter is only a symptom of the disease.
      </p>

      <p class="bold-breakpoint">
        In software, the world is enamored with AI generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        An obvious split between CEO’s who demand we accept it as the new thing,
        the workers who do and don’t care about the results, and the craftsmen
        who see it as no better than a hammer. A simple tool whose use is as
        limited as any other. As with all tools, the answer to, "Should we use
        it?" is never, "Yes, always." Only, "It depends."
      </p>

      <p>
        But software culture has for many ears been moving away from the concept
        of engineering. The job doesn’t require a degree, certification, or any
        sort of academic rigor. Today you allegedly don’t even need to know how
        to code. Vibe coding a CLI in Rust now qualifies as learning Rust.
      </p>

      <p>
        This by itself isn’t the end of the world. Programming has always been
        on the path to becoming more "high-level." It only gets more accessible
        over time. Rust is more accessible than C. Go is more accessible than
        Java. There have even been many attempts at building "low-code" and
        "no-code" tools. Those in Salesforce and ServiceNow are familiar with
        the extremely monotonous work of trying to write scripts with UI clicks.
      </p>

      <p>
        But AI isn’t the next step in "high-level" coding. It’s not even in the
        same family. To see LLM’s as anything more than a heavy-duty, far more
        expensive tool in the ML toolset is, I believe, naive and misinformed.
        If you want a chat support agent, basic Natural Language Processing with
        pre-approved automation scripts similar to the original Apple Siri and
        Google Assistants are far better options. Not only are they cheaper, but
        they work better. Someone sends a message to what they understand to be
        a bot, they get clickable options back, and they’re asked to answer a
        few form questions. Simple, straightforward. Anything that doesn’t work
        can be handled by a human, and new cases can be added in a clear,
        determinate, and testable way.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the world has currently forgotten about these solutions. It is too
        obsessed with LLM’s. Mostly because they are being shoved down people’s
        throats. And this is one of the reasons this whole thing feels less like
        a revolution and more like a trend.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary "experts" speaking to the media are CEOs of the companies
        selling it. Sam Altman recognizes the power and influence of

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >Theo Von</a
        >. These shows famously give anyone they find interesting the space to
        talk at length about anything they want to talk about. It’s not a gotcha
        game, there's no drama, and the hosts will only push back on very
        obvious bullshit. Not speculative things they are not experts in. It's
        why people (including me) love these podcasts. It’s not about the
        personality of the host. It’s a simple long form discussion about
        interesting things. But similar to how you shouldn’t take medical advice
        from Joe Rogan, you also need to be capable of recognizing bullshit
        without a podcast or news host telling you it’s bullshit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The debate among developers is a very old one stemming from the fact
        that this is not a disciplined science. The reality is most developers
        are treated as technical data entry. Write your little if conditions and
        for loops to do exactly as you’re told. Developers have grown to accept
        this and even support it. Because it allows them to do easy work for
        6-figures. They have frankly figured out how to hack the system. Quit
        every 2 years for a 10–20% raise, put all of their time into studying
        for tech interviews, don’t bother learning to scale and maintain. This
        sounds harsh, but long before LLMs showed up, very few developers gave a
        damn about knowing how to code. In fact, with every new tech trend they
        find new excuses to proudly justify this. "Coding is easy, after a while
        real developers get AWS certified and get into DevOps." Why would you
        promote a developer into DevOps rather than an ISP field-technician? The
        work is more closely aligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resistance to understanding the craft of software engineering (not
        development) is, in my frank opinion, one that is avoided out of fear of
        one’s own incompetence being exposed. It is the same real reason people
        are quitting every two years for absurd raises. Because if they stuck
        around long enough to have ownership over... anything at all, they would
        have to face facts that this job is actually difficult.
      </p>

      <p class="bold-breakpoint">Let’s take a break for a second.</p>

      <p>
        Having deficiencies in your knowledge is OK at any level. Admitting it
        shows honesty and a willingness to learn. I don’t consider myself to be
        very "good," but I care. What I’m really ranting about here are those
        who pretend to be above everyone else and produce hot dogshit that falls
        apart after a year. The kind of stuff contractors are hired to fix at an
        hourly rate. This arrogance is the real problem. This work is easily
        replaceable by AI. But this work shouldn’t exist in the first place.
        There is an entire group of people producing broken code, thinking it’s
        normal, never having to fix their own work, thinking that AI is just as
        good at development as any human because that’s all they’ve ever known.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked with extraordinarily talented people. But I won’t lie and
        act as if everyone I’ve worked with should have been there. This is a
        well-understood part of the job by anyone that cares about the job. You
        will always be surrounded by people who want to get their check and go
        home. There are plenty of people who will proudly admit to this
        publicly. In fact, in the "age of vibe coding" people are getting more
        confident about this. I’m not here to judge your arguments about using a
        bot to do your work for you, so you can go do whatever you would rather
        be doing. If you’ve been angry with me since I compared DevOps to field
        technicians, I’ll do my best to get to the point soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a shift happening. More people will proudly and publicly
        proclaim they don’t know how to build software. Fewer people are brave
        enough to proudly proclaim that they do know how. There is a growing
        stigma against caring about the work. People who know how to do the job
        fear losing job prospects. Instead, the most brave, talented developers
        make an attempt at being nuanced. "AI is good for prototyping..."
        "Listen, I use it daily, but personally, these are the issues I see..."
        In the meantime, the vibe coders only get more aggressive. When they are
        hacked, apps fail, or contractors are asked to fix their slop, they will
        say, "It’s always been like this." And they’re right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you know why contractors are so cranky, beaten down, cynical, and
        full of themselves? Because it’s always been like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Full-time developers who confidently go with the flow and just assume
        whatever they do will have bugs and regular failures do very well in
        this industry. They continue to quit their jobs every 2 years for a
        10–20% raise and enjoy a kitchen remodel while they study for the next
        tech interview. Blissfully unaware and uncaring of the work they left
        behind. Claim that if they don’t get those raises, they wouldn’t be able
        to pay their bills. Probably true considering the cost of a mortgage on
        a $300,000 house, payments on a $200,000 car, and don’t forget that
        remodel. But you know... it’s for the kids. This isn’t just a mean,
        jealousy rant. If that’s your life, that’s your life. There is a bigger
        problem I’m getting at here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our need to constantly entertain ourselves is impacting the way we view
        work. It’s not about having a purpose anymore. Don’t learn to code,
        watch an AI churn away like mindlessly watching the loading bars as you
        play idle mobile games like
        <a
          href="https://hyperhippo.com/games/adventure-capitalist/"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >Adventure Capitalist</a
        >. The "real work," you tell yourself, is knowing which upgrade button
        to click next. Results? Maintenance? That’s not even in your vocabulary.
        And why should it be? You’ve been richly rewarded for caring about one
        thing only. Appeasing other people’s need to be continuously entertained
        so long as you are continuously entertained. They want to tell you
        exactly what they want, and you as the developer aren’t an expert.
        You’re not an engineer. You can’t say that fancy bridge design will
        collapse in 3 years. You just write the little if conditions and for
        loops to make it work.
      </p>

      <p>
        And with LLMs, they don’t need you for this at all. They can just vibe
        code their idea. If they have only ever seen you, the developer, as a
        low-level laborer means to an end... well, to them, you are no different
        from an AI. And if you, the developer, have accepted this position and
        told yourself that this job is nothing but knowing how to pass a tech
        interview, then you are no different from an AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        The very fact that we have accepted this state of the world as
        inevitable gives credence to the theory that we’re living in a
        simulation and our only purpose is to develop and test new technologies.
        Even at the cost of ourselves. One could argue that this is a very
        Western theory, but let’s suppose the happier tribal communities are
        just controls. It doesn’t matter, I really don’t want to go down this
        line of thinking. My only point in bringing up the "simulation" is to
        say that we are truly ridiculous.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think God doesn’t particularly care about most of what we do as
        humans. Inventing "AI" or social media are trite, uninteresting side
        effects of free will. Render unto Caesar and all that. What He cares
        about above all else is that we love Him and one another. There is a
        thread in the revolutionary beliefs of Jesus that it is more difficult
        for the rich to get into heaven. It would be easier for a camel to fit
        through the head of a needle. Jesus loved parables for a few reasons. I
        think he had a bit of a comedic bone sometimes. The camel through a
        needle point is not literal, but the message is very real.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have stopped caring about one another, about our crafts, and about
        our purpose. Obsessed with moving faster, harder, hacking the system to
        squeeze as much money out of it as possible. Creating, building, helping
        one another with our skills is a lost art. Burnout isn’t in the DSM,
        it’s not a disease, it’s a mood. Developers are obsessed with their own
        efficiency. Using VIM and never touching a mouse to only use keyboard
        shortcuts has turned into the incorrect belief that using LLMs make them
        faster. It doesn’t matter if they’re actually moving faster or not, what
        matters most is that it feels like they do. As long as they’re getting
        that oh so addicting hit of dopamine.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s worse is we’ve pushed this mentality onto employers and clients
        alike. It wasn’t evil capitalists that turned us into drones for the
        machine. It was us. Driven by hyper competition, imposter syndrome, and
        focusing on easy money rather than learning to do the job. This
        anxiety-filled list of drives is only one layer of an anxiety pyramid.
        Just beneath it at the foundation is a need to be entertained. To always
        be "on," moving, doing something. Boredom is a luxury that younger
        generations aren’t experiencing. Put any generation in front of a Studio
        Ghibli film or even a classic Disney movie, and they’ll be shifting
        around looking for a phone to distract themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do we honestly believe this dopamine addiction isn’t effecting the rest
        of our lives? That it hasn’t scaled so far that it’s affected our
        society? How many people can sit on a porch and take an hour to drink a
        glass of lemonade without their mind, at the very least wandering to
        technology?

        I think we need to remember that when we die, no matter what you
        believe, you don’t get to take anything with you. Having a lot of money
        to leave behind is not an inherent good. It’s no better than not.
        Obtaining money by "hacking the system" rather than it being a true side
        effect of the outpouring of your love and passion is not a good thing.

        There are too many people in this world, the majority, it seems, that
        would respond to my words with, "That’s nice but... [I need to pay my
        bills] [this is reality] [we can’t all have passion]." This is exactly
        the reason for my defensiveness. Surrounded by those who feel empowered,
        who feel like they’re in the majority, and can proudly proclaim that
        they don’t know what they’re doing other than making money.

        There are plenty of industries "ruined by soullessness." So to speak.
        Artists in film, music, theater, and comedy know this game well. I feel
        like it’s only a matter of time that instead of hearing stories about
        burnout, I start to hear about suicides and cocaine addictions as you do
        with Hollywood. Why so extreme? I’m probably wrong. But what’s
        undeniable is the unhealthy behaviors inherent in the industry.

        The reason Studio Ghibli stands out to me. It’s slow pace, deep
        messaging that isn’t just handed to you. It’s a clear work of love and
        of passion. I don’t see this much in software. It’s not even from a
        nerdy programming perspective. A dashboard for doctor’s offices, an
        ecommerce store. Building the features and trying to fit in the
        forgotten necessities clients don’t care about and don’t want to hear
        about. Performance, security, maintainability.

        Very few people think about or appreciate the little details. They just
        want to see something on screen, to get that instant satisfaction. Like
        making a fast food order or getting constant positive feedback from a
        mobile game. And there are plenty of people in the world that will take
        advantage of that. Grifters, scammers, thieves. Who will take an absurd
        amount of money and leave the work to hourly contractors after they’re
        gone. (Yes, I’m referring to those who quit every two years.)

        The point I want to get across here comes down to this.

        For those with a problem to solve, who know an industry well but can’t
        program. AI is an understandable solution. You have been scammed long
        enough. But the thing is, this AI is built and marketed by the same
        sorts of people that have been scamming you with 6-figure salaries only
        to leave before things get serious. They’ve simply automated the work.
        It’s not the answer. You should be paying less for the labor but giving
        more time for the results. Find engineers interested in testing and
        doing more for you than a bot can. Find people who want to stick around.
        Find people who will work for less just for the love of the game. Use
        low salaries to filter out the grifters.

        For developers. Instead of spending all of your time trying to leetcode
        hack interviews for more pay, I want you to consider the following
        options.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="list-item">
          <strong>Sales:</strong> Working for uncapped commissions busting your
          balls perfecting a script is probably what you would rather be doing
          right now. You might be better at it than you think. You might be
          happier using sales to speed run your way through all the cycles of
          burnout. Don’t do this in software. You are killing this industry.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          <strong>Work for less:</strong> Developers in the US who aren’t
          directly contributing to the sciences should be perfectly happy with a
          median wage of $60,000/year at the senior level. Nobody should be
          doing this for money. $60/k US median is enough to pay your bills and
          make your children happy. If it isn’t, you’ve made poor life choices.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          <strong>Start a business:</strong> Put your own damn money on the
          line. If you really insist on being rich, take the risk with your own
          money and reputation, not someone else’s. Stop trying to stack equity
          deals like it’s ethical. I believe real business evolves on its own
          when opportunity reaches out to shake hands with the capable. If two
          people meet in an "entrepreneur" discord chat room and brainstorm on,
          "How can we make f*** you money? What are the current trends?" Well, I
          can’t stop them. If that’s you, go do that. Software salaries are not
          the correct strategy.

        I wrote all of this with pen and paper sitting on an apartment balcony
        on a 90-degree day. I’m sweating, but the birds are chirping. I don’t
        know why this is such a better experience than, "There are probably 100
        bugs, but we shipped." Maybe one is just nature, and the other is a
        willful act of negligence. One is the clear creation of passion and
        love. The other is a desperate, anxiety-induced pursuit of money.
