        <p>Prioritizing thoughtful engagement over instant reactions</p>
      </header>

      <article>
        <p>
          In our increasingly interconnected world, there's a pervasive
          expectation to comment, react, and engage instantly. Whether it’s a
          LinkedIn post or a personal blog, the absence of a comment section
          often raises questions. However, my decision to disable comments isn’t
          a dismissal of dialogue. Instead, it’s a deliberate choice to
          cultivate a different kind of engagement—one that values depth,
          reflection, and a healthier digital environment for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>The Algorithmic Influence on Our Minds</h2>
        <p>
          Social media algorithms are incredibly sophisticated, designed with
          one primary goal: to maximize "engagement." They achieve this by
          feeding us content that elicits strong, often immediate, reactions.
          This constant, rapid stream of information has profoundly impacted our
          collective attention span.
          <a

            >Research by Gloria Mark</a
          >, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine,
          highlights a significant decline in average attention spans on
          screens—from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to a mere 47 seconds in recent years.
          This incessant "attention switching" can lead to increased stress and
          errors. Short-form video content and a barrage of notifications

        <p>
          Beyond simply shortening our attention, these algorithms frequently
          push us towards content designed to spark disagreement. They learn
          what keeps us scrolling, and unfortunately, controversy and outrage
          are highly effective engagement drivers. Studies have shown that

            >social media algorithms amplify emotionally charged and divisive
            content</a
          >, even when users report that such content makes them feel worse
          about political outgroups. This dynamic often creates echo chambers
          and filter bubbles, where we are primarily exposed to viewpoints that
          confirm our existing biases, making genuine, nuanced discussion
          incredibly difficult. The underlying goal isn’t productive debate, but
          rather to keep us hooked,

        </p>

        <h2>My Personal Path to Disconnecting</h2>
        <p>
          To illustrate this, consider my own experience: LinkedIn is, in fact,
          the only "social media" platform I still actively use. Yet even there,
          the algorithmic pull towards engagement can be insidious. I once
          accumulated around 1,800 connections, most of whom I didn’t know and
          had no idea why we were connected in the first place. This stemmed
          from a time when I mistakenly believed that a large network signified
          something meaningful. I’ve since undertaken a massive purge, removing
          every connection I possibly could. Due to platform bugs or perhaps
          deleted accounts, I couldn’t remove every single one, but when I visit
          "My Network," it’s empty. LinkedIn now serves as a simple professional
          profile and a platform for my newsletter—nothing more. Despite this
          intentional detachment, I still find myself occasionally drawn into
          ridiculous comment threads when LinkedIn’s algorithm recommends posts
          that disagree with my own content. This constant exposure to
          engineered conflict is not healthy, and I am actively doing my best to
          opt out.
        </p>

        <p>
          My approach to consuming information is also a direct counter to the
          algorithmic curation prevalent today. I do not rely on curated news
          sites or algorithmically driven content feeds. Instead, I leverage the
          power of RSS feeds. I subscribe to literally hundreds of RSS feeds,
          including those from YouTube channels, ensuring that I receive content
          directly from its source, sorted by "last published" rather than by
          "most controversial" or "most engaging." This method provides a much
          better appreciation for personal and professional blogs, allowing me
          to discover and follow voices without the overwhelming noise of
          traditional news sites. I find just looking at the homepages of
          excessively noisy news sites like InfoWorld or GeekWire to be
          anxiety-inducing. This is, in my opinion, a better way to engage with
          the web: to depend on interlinked sites and your own curated sources
          for new information, fostering a more intentional and less manipulated
          consumption of content.
        </p>

        <h2>The Erosion of Listening and the Entitlement to Speak</h2>
        <p>
          When every post is an invitation to comment, we risk losing the
          fundamental art of simply listening or reading. There's a growing
          sense of entitlement to have one’s immediate thoughts heard,
          regardless of whether they add value or are well-considered. This
          instant-reaction culture often bypasses critical thinking,
          <a
            href="https://www.enablinglearning.com/teaching-critical-thinking-in-the-age-of-ai-and-social-media/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >favoring emotional responses over reasoned arguments</a
          >. When comments are disabled, or individuals are blocked for
          persistent argumentative behavior, it can be perceived as an affront—a
          denial of their "right" to express themselves. However, the purpose of
          a blog or a professional post is often to share insights, not to open
          a free-for-all forum for every fleeting thought or manufactured
          disagreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Reclaiming Space for Thought and Real Life</h2>
        <p>
          By removing the comment section, I aim to create a space for focused
          consumption. It encourages readers to absorb the content, reflect on
          it, and form their own conclusions without the immediate pressure to
          respond or be drawn into tangential arguments. If you disagree with
          something I’ve written, that’s perfectly fine. You don’t have to let
          me know. I’m not isolating myself by not hearing you out in
          particular; nor is it a refusal to hear "differing viewpoints." We are
          strangers, and we don’t HAVE to be in conversation. This approach
          prioritizes the quality of the shared content and the mental
          well-being of both the creator and the audience, fostering an
          environment where information can be considered without the constant
          noise and pressure of the algorithmic feedback loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I believe people should seriously consider stepping away
          from social media. Stop thinking you need to be "heard" by the entire
          world. Stop believing you need to be "part of the conversation" with
          complete strangers who are being actively manipulated by social media
          algorithms. Instead, read, write, and reflect. Focus on the real world
          without expecting that everything you say should be a response to or a
          reaction to someone else. Go out and simply be yourself.
