        <h1>Where’d the Team Go?</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          This will be my second installment of long rants that guarantees I
          will never find a job again. But it really comes down to is personal
          reflections on what I am seeing in an industry compared to the good
          and bad times I’ve had working in it.
        </p>

        <p>Here is an AI analysis of this blog:</p>

        <p>
          The blog post, "Where’d the Team Go?," is a candid critique of the
          modern software development industry’s cultural shortcomings. The
          author argues that a widespread fear of clear communication and
          accountability is leading to dysfunctional teams and low-quality
          software. They contrast this with established methodologies like
          Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD), which they believe foster
          clarity and prevent bugs from the outset. A key point of contention is
          the use of vague language and a "what do you mean?" defensive reflex,
          which the author sees has a symptom of a broader issue with anxiety and
          burnout. The post also expresses skepticism about the current
          obsession with AI, arguing that it simply magnifies existing problems
          when not built upon a foundation of human-driven, clear requirements.
          Ultimately, the author suggests that the industry’s focus on
          "fast-paced" environments over genuine teamwork and quality processes
          is detrimental, contrasting this with their perception of more
          effective, disciplined approaches found in military or highly
          successful tech companies.
        </p>

        <p>And now for my part:</p>

        <p>
          The obsession with AI/LLM persists even though objectively speaking, I
          have seen no great revolution. Google is making more money as they
          always do. Start-ups are burning with hot fire and crashing as they
          always do. Companies and consumers with no relation to tech are sick
          and f***ing tired of hearing about our stupid trends. As they always
          have.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what I want to write about today on my porch is testing. Or
          quality control. Or something like that. Let’s just jump into it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been reading the
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) Guide</a
            ></strong
          >, and just in the first chapter it discusses <strong>BDD</strong> vs.
          <strong>ATDD</strong> for methods of writing and handling
          requirements. BDD is preferred by non-technical stakeholders because
          it means requirements are written in plain English. ATDD, on the other
          hand, is more precise. It means agreeing on technical test cases,
          writing automated tests, and only when a test fails a software
          engineer may modify production code. This is beneficial. It means
          clear agreement on requirements, translating those to automated tests,
          and passing said tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can’t tell you how much wasted time in meetings this saves. People
          complain about too many meetings, but that’s not the problem. The
          problem is there aren’t enough useful meetings with actual
          communication. The typical flow seems to be a project manager and CTO
          meet with a client, they write up a very loose BDD document in
          Microsoft Word, then create a backlog of tickets. These tickets are
          rarely written with any detail. Often half-sentence notes with an
          imaginary reference to a Word doc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software engineers are left guessing, asking questions, and honestly
          treated like morons by the only people with real information. So they
          pull teeth and guess. Who cares, they’ll just quit in 2 years anyway.
          Or find a way to get “promoted” so they too can spend all their time
          in Confluence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meetings, from this point, become pointless standups where you either
          say, “no update, no blockers” and get a smile. Or say, “I don’t
          understand what this 3-word ticket is trying to say,” and get a sigh.
          Welcome to the doghouse. Start applying now.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what if we followed the standards of the SWEBOK Guide? It means
          agreeing on test cases. And the feature is complete when these test
          cases pass. Software engineers make no changes until they have test
          cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Excuse me, what? It can be this simple? Why have I never worked in an
          environment like this? The closest equivalent was a requirement to
          keep test coverage >80%. The result of that was 0 bugs. Conflicts were
          known immediately before pushing any code.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What was that? Zero bugs? That’s not possible.” I hear you say. But
          it is. Deterministic computer programs are infallible. It is only
          humans who make mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I fear. And this is where I really get into trouble. If you are a
          recruiter or hiring, please stop reading now. I fear there is a
          culture in software that doesn’t allow for correcting mistakes. You
          can make mistakes, sure, but god forbid you ever admit to it, or
          anyone suggests it be fixed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not the same as recognizing mistakes. Shipping software with
          100 bugs is considered acceptable. “We’ll just iterate.” “Put that in
          a bug ticket.” But if anyone suggests agreeing on requirements, API
          contracts, test cases, talking about ways to avoid mistakes to begin
          with… welcome to the doghouse. Start applying now.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is without a doubt cultural sensitivity. If your ESLint
          configuration gives you an error, “<a
            href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-useless-assignment"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >no useless assignment</a
          >,” and you tell your peer that their code as a useless assignment,
          even just quoting the error, expect a call from your manager. 100% of
          the time, on every team. I have never seen an exception to this. I
          have never gone to a manager and said, “He called me useless. That
          language is inappropriate!” But I imagine that’s what must be
          happening. “We don’t use language like that here.” You’re in software,
          yes, you do. Imagine being offended by a very accurate and useful
          ESLint rule and blaming it on your peer. I can’t. But I’ve seen it, a
          lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Slowly, people have just stopped communicating altogether. You put on
          a mask, learn to say the right words, keep your head down, and get
          really good at redirecting disagreement or problems in a way that puts
          everyone else on the defensive and makes you look ignorant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s say person B says, “Our bug backlog is very long and growing. I
          think we can tighten up static analysis and improve test coverage,
          I’ve written up a detailed plan on how this can be done with no real
          additional time cost.” Person A responds with, “What do you mean?”
        </p>

        <p>
          I find the question, “What do you mean?” in contexts like this to be
          infuriating. I have only ever seen defensive and sensitive people act
          like this. When I say, “defensive and sensitive,” I don’t mean in the
          realm of healthy. I mean in the realm of their teammates should be
          finding ways to make them aware and get them help. And I do believe
          there is an industry-wide psychology diagnosis to be made that affects
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Burnout is caused by getting stuck in fight or flight and frying your
          nervous system. There is a deep anxiety and fear hidden under the
          question. Which is naturally designed to redirect the other person to
          be on the defensive. It is not a question asked in earnest. It’s a
          defensive reflex.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What do I mean?” Person B could say, “I’ve made it very clear, I have
          written out a plan that you haven’t looked at. There are 1,000 user
          reported bugs on the backlog. What do I mean??”
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s no good response to this. Google Gemini suggests turning it
          back on them. Something along the lines of, “I think I was very clear,
          what about what I just said is confusing to you?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Oof. Imagine being in this standup. You probably have. This isn’t
          going well. Person B, welcome to the doghouse. Start applying now.
        </p>

        <p>
          What’s so fascinating to me is whether I’m in this situation or
          witnessing it, I have always seen Person A as the toxic aggressor.
          Even if I’m the one asking, “What do you mean?” and someone calls me
          out on it, I will apologize and recognize the need to listen, think
          critically, read, and get back to them with a real question or
          opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if I’m the person to say, “What part is unclear?” and I’m accused
          of being rude, we are not friends. And I’m livid anytime I see this
          done to someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a culture of sensitivity and damaged nervous systems, Person A is
          seen as “just asking a question.” In a healthy social culture someone
          would probably break the tension by making fun of Person A. “What do
          YOU mean? What do you mean by ‘what’? That depends on what the
          definition of ‘is’ is!” A healthy team would move on and consider the
          solution at hand. Giving Person A the space to breathe and recover
          from a stupid question.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not in tech. Instead, everyone sits in silence, watching two people
          play stupid games, until one quits or gets fired.
        </p>

        <p>
          And so we seem to have a fear of communication and clarity. Developers
          guessing at requirements, broken product is OK, and now people are
          using AI to generate documentation and tests. Proclaiming how
          efficient they are because of how many tokens they paid for. Counting
          them like poker chips, forgetting that only the house wins.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a clear proven standard outlined by ATDD in the SWEBOK Guide.
          A clear path between requirements, tests, and code. This is
          communication. Talking about what’s wanted, documenting conversation,
          agreeing on test cases, and building the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where is the room for AI generation here? If you AI generate your
          documentation with clients, there is a 100% chance of
          misinterpretation. Not 50%, 100%. If developers just start slapping
          keyboards based on a verbal idea or Figma designs, there is a 100%
          chance of misinterpretation. If they don’t write tests and just AI
          generate them after, creating random inputs into random functions,
          there is no possible way code is being written to requirements.
          Because no technical requirements have been written and there is no
          definition of done.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’ll just iterate.” On what? You have nothing. No standard. No
          agreement. No goals. Just loose words and random ideas that everyone
          has a different interpretation of. Including your AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’re not Google.” That’s clear. But last I checked communication was
          free and saves time. So I don’t know what the argument is here.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this sounds to me like, “I’m afraid. If I communicate, I will
          offend.” Yes, that’s the risk. That is damn near the definition of
          communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t put a lot of weight on my military experience. It wasn’t much.
          And I have been yelled at and screamed at by recruiters for putting it
          on my résumé. For most of my tech career it felt safer to hide.
          Because while it helps for most jobs, in tech you’re assumed to not be
          a culture fit. Because military culture isn’t sensitivity culture. You
          get chewed out or made fun of for, “What do you mean?” Everyone knows
          it’s a jackass thing to do. Whether it’s on purpose or an
          anxiety-induced reflex. It’s a habit that should be worked on.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when I think about what a “team” is, or what “leadership” is, or
          what “clarity” means, I often think about the military. Where if you
          play games, people lose their lives. You don’t get the luxury of a
          shit turnover rate and never having to learn to get along with people.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re Person A, the “what do you mean?” type, you can keep your
          head down and be one of the three people who stay at the company.
          While every other asshole is a rotating door every 1–2 years. If
          you’re one of the assholes, you only have to act polite for 1–2 years
          before you burnout and quit for another new exciting job. If you’re in
          the Army, you get to sleep next to each other until you learn to stop
          acting like children.
        </p>

        <p>
          My point though, in bringing up the military, is I can’t find teams.
          I’ve done a lot of interviews, a lot of contracts. If I bring up the
          concept of “team” as something I’m looking for, I’m sure as hell not
          getting a call back. No, I need to say, “I’m looking for a FAST-PACED,
          DYNAMIC, CROSS-FUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT WITH FREE MOUNTAIN DEW!!! AND
          AI!!! I LOVE AI!!!!!!”
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m not kidding when I say this is the kind of script that gets you
          hired. Minus the part about Mountain Dew. I believe it’s because
          people have been permanently operating in a fight or flight mode for a
          very long time and expect it as normal behavior. If you’re not
          absolutely wired for pushing slop as quickly as possible, you’re not
          welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          That doesn’t mean if you’re not the “fastest,” you’re not welcome,
          only if you don’t act like it. The “fastest” people are using TDD and
          communication. Those Google’s of the world that didn’t just beat you
          to market, but put your broken slop to shame. If you get lucky, maybe
          they’ll buy you out.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it’s not just because they make more money and have more
          engineers. Their product teams are often 7ish people with similar
          budgets. What makes them more effective is standard processes and
          communication. The stuff average teams are afraid of; unit tests,
          integration tests, and E2E tests. Google has this idea of the “three
          amigos,” product managers, developers, and testers. Sounds familiar,
          right?
        </p>

        <p>
          “Unit tests are useless!!” Get out of here. I’m not entertaining this
          voice of incompetence and fear anymore. It’s time to wrap this up.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lack of teamwork and communication in this industry has driven me
          mad. And AI is only multiplying its effects. I don’t think we’ll ever
          live in a world where everyone we know doesn’t have a laundry list of
          complaints about the software and computers they depend on. And many
          people will lean on this, “If it will always be broken, let’s just
          ship broken.” It will become their mantra, they’ll say it’s why they
          move so “fast,” but never quantify that with real long-term numbers.
          This makes it very difficult to be truly happy about ones work.
        </p>

        <p>
          If anyone claims to be “happy” or “competent” about shipping 100 bugs
          in two weeks, I fear they don’t know what either of those things feels
          like. I have felt these things, but they are rare in tech. And I hope
          everyone gets a moment to reflect and find both.
