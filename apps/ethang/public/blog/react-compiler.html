        Recently, a video titled
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw8w2O5Y0no"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"

          >“The React Compiler”</a
        >
        caught my attention. It showcases the exciting prospect of React
        automatically optimizing our components, promising to solve the
        notorious re-rendering problem without the manual burden of
        <code class="inline-code">useMemo</code> and
        <code class="inline-code">useCallback</code>. While the idea is
        undoubtedly appealing, and a testament to the ongoing innovation within
        the React ecosystem, it also prompts a deeper, more critical look at
        what truly drives performance in complex UI frameworks.
      </p>

      <h2 id="promise_of_effortless_optimization">
        The Promise of Effortless Optimization
      </h2>
      <p>
        The core premise of the React Compiler is to make memoization automatic.
        For years, React developers have wrestled with identifying and wrapping
        components, props, and callbacks with
        <code class="inline-code">React.memo</code>,
        <code class="inline-code">useMemo</code>, and
        <code class="inline-code">useCallback</code> to prevent unnecessary
        re-renders. This manual process is often tedious, error-prone, and can
        even introduce its own performance overhead if applied indiscriminately.
        The compiler aims to eliminate this cognitive load, theoretically
        allowing developers to write idiomatic React code while the compiler
        intelligently optimizes the rendering tree. It’s a vision of “write
        once, optimize automatically,” which sounds like a dream come true for
        many.
      </p>

      <h2 id="when_memoization_falls_short">
        When Memoization Falls Short: The Reality of High-Velocity Data
      </h2>
      <p>
        However, for anyone who has truly grappled with high-performance React
        applications – think real-time dashboards, collaborative editors, or
        complex data visualizations – the compiler’s promise, while helpful for
        common scenarios, doesn’t quite address the fundamental bottlenecks. The
        Achilles’ heel of memoization, whether manual or automatic, lies in its
        reliance on reference equality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a scenario where you’re receiving high-velocity, real-time data
        over a WebSocket connection. This data often comes in as an array or an
        object. Even if only a single value within that array or object changes,
        the entire array or object reference will likely be new on each update.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s say you have a component displaying a list of stock prices:</p>
      <pre><code><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function-name">StockList</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="punctuation">{</span> <span class="variable">data</span> <span class="punctuation">}</span><span class="punctuation">)</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="comment">// data is an array of stock objects: [{ symbol: 'AAPL', price: 150.00 }, ...]</span>
  <span class="comment">// Even if only one price changes, the 'data' array reference will be new.</span>
  <span class="comment">// A compiler-applied memoization on StockList won't prevent re-renders here.</span>
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="punctuation">(</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;div&gt;</span>
      <span class="tag">&lt;h2&gt;</span><span class="string">Live Stock Prices</span><span class="tag">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
      <span class="tag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">{</span><span class="variable">data</span><span class="punctuation">.</span><span class="function-name">map</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="variable">stock</span> <span class="operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="punctuation">(</span>
          <span class="tag">&lt;li</span> <span class="attribute">key</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="string">{stock.symbol}</span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>
            <span class="punctuation">{</span><span class="variable">stock</span><span class="punctuation">.</span><span class="variable">symbol</span><span class="punctuation">}</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="punctuation">{</span><span class="variable">stock</span><span class="punctuation">.</span><span class="variable">price</span><span class="punctuation">}</span>
          <span class="tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="punctuation">)</span><span class="punctuation">)</span><span class="punctuation">}</span>
      <span class="tag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="punctuation">)</span><span class="punctuation">;</span>
<span class="punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Similarly, if you’re working with immutable data structures (a common
        pattern for predictable state management), any modification, no matter
        how small, results in a new object or array reference. In these
        scenarios, the very mechanism that memoization relies upon—stable
        references—is inherently broken. The compiler, while clever, cannot
        magically make a new reference equal to an old one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This illustrates a common pitfall:
        <code class="inline-code">React.memo</code> performs a shallow
        comparison of props. If a prop is an object or array, and its reference
        changes (even if its <em>contents</em> are the same),
        <code class="inline-code">React.memo</code> will consider it a change
        and trigger a re-render. This is basically putting all data into a React
        component and then going in behind it trying to memoize; it doesn’t
        work. It suggests a reactive, top-down data flow that makes effective
        memoization challenging. If a parent component holds all the data and
        passes it down, re-renders at the top will naturally ripple downwards,
        bypassing many memoization efforts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="addressing_deep_equality_argument">
        Addressing the “Deep Equality” Argument
      </h3>
      <p>
        A common counterpoint to the limitations of
        <code class="inline-code">React.memo</code>’s shallow comparison is the
        ability to provide a custom comparison function, often a deep equality
        check, as its second argument. While this technique <em>can</em> prevent
        re-renders when prop references change but their underlying contents
        remain the same, it introduces its own set of significant
        considerations:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance Cost of Deep Equality</strong>: Performing a deep
          comparison can be computationally expensive, especially for large,
          complex objects or arrays, or in scenarios with very frequent updates.
          The overhead of traversing and comparing potentially deep data
          structures might, in certain cases, be more costly than the re-render
          it aims to prevent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hiding Underlying Issues</strong>: Relying extensively on deep
          equality comparisons can inadvertently mask suboptimal data flow
          patterns. If components frequently receive new references to large
          data structures that necessitate deep comparison, it often indicates
          that they are receiving more data than they truly need, or that state
          updates are too broad and affect many components unnecessarily.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Still Reactive, Not Proactive</strong>: Even with a deep
          equality check, the component is still <em>reacting</em> to changes in
          its entire prop structure. It doesn’t inherently know
          <em>which specific part</em> of a deeply nested prop changed, only
          that <em>something</em> is different. This contrasts sharply with an
          external store approach, where a component explicitly subscribes to
          <em>only</em> the precise, granular data it needs, triggering updates
          solely when that specific piece of data changes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="fundamental_challenge_react_reconciliation">
        The Fundamental Challenge: React’s Reconciliation Model
      </h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the specifics of memoization, the core challenge for
        high-performance applications in React stems from its fundamental
        reconciliation model. React’s approach, often described as “blow away
        the entire UI and re-render all of it” (though optimized by the Virtual
        DOM), prioritizes developer ergonomics and a consistent, declarative UI.
        However, this comes with inherent performance trade-offs when compared
        to frameworks designed for fine-grained reactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s impossible to deny that frameworks like SolidJS have won the
        competition of performant reactive frameworks. Spending a little time
        working with them, you realize the entire concept of the Virtual DOM and
        managing renders in React may have been overkill in hindsight. As
        Angular, Vue, Preact, Qwik, and Svelte have implemented signals for
        fine-grained reactivity, it feels like React is falling behind in raw
        performance metrics for highly dynamic UIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The React team themselves have historically shown less preference for
        complex, client-side heavy SPAs, often advocating for server-side
        rendering (e.g., via Next.js). This perspective makes sense, as React’s
        design often shines brightest when much of the state and rendering logic
        is handled on the server, offloading the most demanding tasks from the
        client. This leads to a situation where, for highly interactive,
        client-side-intensive applications, developers often find themselves
        “fighting the framework” to achieve desired performance levels.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rule_for_true_react_performance">
        The #1 Rule for True React Performance: Keep Your Data Away From React
      </h2>
      <p>
        This brings us to the core philosophy for achieving genuine high
        performance in React, a strategy well-understood by those who push the
        framework to its limits:
        <strong>KEEP YOUR DATA AWAY FROM REACT.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>What does this mean in practice?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 id="external_custom_stores">
            External Custom Stores are Your Friends:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Instead of relying on React's internal state (<code
              class="inline-code"
              >useState</code
            >, <code class="inline-code">useReducer</code>) for rapidly changing
            or globally accessed data, consider building your own external state
            management solutions. These custom solutions often employ a
            publisher-subscriber model, allowing components to subscribe only to
            the <em>specific</em> pieces of data they need. This bypasses
            React's reconciliation process for the vast majority of updates,
            leading to significantly fewer re-renders.
          </p>
          <p>
            A powerful approach involves using a class-based system for your
            stores. This pattern centralizes related state and operations in a
            single class, acting as the single source of truth for a specific
            domain in your application. This offers several compelling reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Encapsulation</strong>: A class naturally encapsulates
              related state and behavior, making it easier to reason about and
              maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Testing</strong>: Class methods are straightforward to
              test without the complexity of testing hooks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: UI components can focus
              on rendering while the store handles state management and business
              logic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Precise Control Over Rendering</strong>: You decide
              exactly when to notify subscribers, giving you fine-grained
              control over when React re-renders.
            </li>

              <strong>No Dependency on React</strong>: The core logic is

            This approach often leverages libraries like Immer for immutable
            updates, allowing you to write mutable-looking code that produces
            new, immutable state objects. The connection to React is then made
            seamlessly using the
            <code class="inline-code">useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector</code>
            hook.

            This paradigm shifts away from passing data down and hoping
            memoization catches unnecessary re-renders, towards a model where
            components declaratively state what data they need, and efficient
            custom state management delivers exactly that.

          <h3>Careful Subscriber Notification:</h3>
          <p>
            When building your own data layers, be meticulous about when and how
            you notify subscribers. Only trigger updates for components that
            genuinely need to react to a change. This is a core principle in
            achieving fine-grained reactivity.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>Keep Performance-Critical Logic Out of Render Components:</h3>
          <p>
            Avoid storing rapidly changing, performance-critical data directly
            in React state variables that trigger re-renders of large component
            trees. If data or logic changes frequently but doesn’t need to
            visually update the entire component, it probably belongs outside of
            React’s direct rendering cycle. This is why many existing state
            management solutions “fight the framework” by pulling state outside
            of React’s lifecycles and controlling its awareness of state
            changes.

          <p>
            For truly granular, high-frequency updates (e.g., animating a single
            element, updating a canvas, or managing cursor position in a text
            editor), sometimes the most performant approach is to bypass React’s
            virtual DOM entirely and directly manipulate the DOM using
            <code class="inline-code">refs</code>. This is what many popular
            form libraries do for input focus, selection, or specific validation
            feedback, and it’s a common pattern in high-performance graphics or
            game development within React.

            Client-Side Sorting and Filtering: A Practical Application of
            External Stores
          </h3>
          <p>
            When dealing with data display, sorting and filtering are common
            requirements. While server-side sorting and filtering are generally
            preferred for performance and scalability, there are scenarios where
            client-side operations are pragmatic, especially with smaller
            datasets or when instant UI feedback is crucial. In such cases,
            leveraging a custom client-side cache or store allows components to
            directly access and sort/filter data without triggering widespread
            re-renders. This is a direct application of pulling exact values via
            selectors out of an external store. However, be mindful of the
            trade-offs, including increased client-side processing and memory
            consumption for large datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, if you need to sort a list of positions by a derived
            value (like P&L dependent on current price), your sorting function
            can look up the live price from your custom store:

      <h2>The Compiler’s Place in the Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        The React Compiler is a fantastic engineering feat. It will undoubtedly
        improve the performance of many average React applications by automating
        best practices that developers often forget or misapply. It will make
        the framework more forgiving and potentially faster for the majority of
        use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when performance truly matters – when you’re dealing with
        hundreds or thousands of updates per second, or when every millisecond
        counts – the compiler won’t magically solve the fundamental
        architectural challenges. In such scenarios, the strategies outlined
        above, which involve carefully managing data flow outside of React’s
        primary rendering mechanism, remain paramount. Essentially, if you’re
        dealing with high-performance logic, the advice translates to: “keep
        your logic away from where this compiler can see it.”
      </p>

      <h2>The Limits of Optimization: Inherent Trade-offs</h2>
      <p>
        React, by its very nature as a virtual DOM-based reconciliation engine,
        introduces a certain level of overhead. It is designed to prioritize
        developer ergonomics and a declarative approach to UI development, which
        inherently comes with performance trade-offs when compared to
        lower-level, imperative DOM manipulation. While the React Compiler is an
        impressive advancement that optimizes rendering and makes the framework
        more efficient for many common use cases, it does not eliminate these
        fundamental architectural characteristics. For applications with extreme
        performance demands, understanding and working within these inherent
        limitations, often by employing strategies that externalize data
        management and leverage direct DOM access, remains crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t to say React isn’t powerful or useful – it’s incredibly so
        for the vast majority of web applications. But it’s crucial to
        understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to employ the right tools
        and architectural patterns for the job, rather than expecting a compiler
        to solve all performance woes. The constant need for a myriad of state
        management solutions, each attempting to “fix” React’s rendering
        process, highlights a core tension: why is React so against fine-grained
        reactivity, a feature that seems like a fundamental purpose of a UI
        library – to provide a mechanism to subscribe HTML to our own state?
