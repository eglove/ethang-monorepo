    >
    on Zero to Mastery I started the AI Engineering Bootcamp to work with AWS
    SageMaker. I'm not an expert in AI, Python or machine learning. But this is
    clearly a skillset that only continues to become more important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting setup with Sagemaker takes a significant amount of time. I used
    Pulumi to setup the initial AWS resources, the
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >source code for that is here</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I got the machine up and running and grabbed a sentiment analysis model
    from HuggingFace it also setup an S3 bucket and EC2 instance automatically.
    This is obviously the most uncomfortable part of cloud platforms. The random
    resources added start to build up over time and it can be easy to forget
    things. This is why I use Pulumi, but it's still uncomfortable that
    resources can and will be allocated from within a Jupyter Notebook in
    Sagemaker.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I ran <code class="kbd kbd-sm">pulumi down</code>, the operation failed
    because there was an app running within the instances I created with Pulumi.
    I had shut it down, but the files you use are stored with AWS storage
    (another cost).
  </p>
  <p>
    Still it will be nice to see how this all comes together as the course
    promises to setup the model on AWS Gateway and test through postman rather
    than a Jupyter Notebook. As well as use custom data and models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of a lot of setup and small charges building up, this feels easy to
    get going. I think largely the challenge here isn't necessarily in the
    software development side of things. But rather in the data science side.
    I'm hoping to learn more about that as I continue.
