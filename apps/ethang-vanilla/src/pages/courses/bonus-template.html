  For the most part, I recommend avoiding courses that charge too much money.
  $300 is way too much. Part of the reason I recommended Academind is they've
  kept reasonable pricing in an environment where instructors expect to pump out
  low quality courses at the end of the year targeting "use it or lost it"
  company stipends.

  The following courses are entirely optional but recommended due to a quality
  unmatched. But the pricing may be too much.
