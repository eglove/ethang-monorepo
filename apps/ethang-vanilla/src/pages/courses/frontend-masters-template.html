  Frontend Masters has world-class instructors leading lecture style workshops
  on just about everything.

  I recommend simply just following the learning paths, even the beginner and
  professional paths that will feel below your skill level at this point. There
  is still a lot of good to pick up. However, I would avoid the framework
  courses (React/Angular/Vue). Frontend Masters and its community is notably
  anti-framework. This isn't the place you want to learn about industry tooling.
  But their deep dives into vanilla tech will make you a better user of
  frameworks.
