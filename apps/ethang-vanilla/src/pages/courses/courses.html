  <h1>Recommended Courses</h1>
  <p>
    This list is meant as a way to provide a straightforward curriculum of what
    you need to learn for development. It's updated constantly, but at any given
    point in time, I believe this is the best way to get started with, and learn
    everything you need to know to work with the web and beyond.

    These courses will take a while to get through, so I do recommend signing up
    for Pro accounts instead of buying one-time courses. So in the beginner
    section, check out Udemy Pro. Keep going with Udemy Pro for Academind's
    courses. Once you're through those, cancel it, move on to the next platform,
    and so on.
