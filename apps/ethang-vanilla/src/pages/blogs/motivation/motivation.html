<h1>Notes on generating motivation in software engineering.</h1>
<h2>Interest</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Personal Interest:</strong> This equates to a developer's
        passion
        for a specific technology, domain, or problem. A developer deeply
        interested in AI will likely persist through challenging AI projects,
        while someone lacking that passion might struggle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Situational Interest:</strong> This reflects the temporary
        excitement generated by a project's context. A well-defined problem, a
        supportive team, or an innovative technology can spark situational
        interest, even in less personally engaging tasks.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Determination</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Intrinsic Motivation:</strong> A developer is intrinsically
        motivated when they find the coding process itself rewarding – driven by
        a
        genuine interest in the problem, the technology, or the creative process
        of building software.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Extrinsic Motivation:</strong> This stems from external rewards
        like bonuses, deadlines, or avoiding negative consequences (e.g.,
        performance reviews). While extrinsic motivation plays a role, it's less
        sustainable than intrinsic motivation.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fueling Intrinsic Motivation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Autonomy:</strong> Developers need a sense of control over their
        work, their methods, and their schedules. Micromanagement directly
        undermines autonomy, leading to decreased motivation and potentially
        burnout. Empowering developers with ownership and decision-making
        authority is crucial.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Competence:</strong> Developers need to feel capable and
        effective. Providing challenging yet achievable tasks, offering
        opportunities for skill development (training, mentorship), and
        celebrating successes fosters a sense of competence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Relatedness:</strong> Developers need to feel connected to their
        team and the larger project. Fostering a collaborative, supportive work
        environment, promoting teamwork, and encouraging knowledge sharing
        strengthens relatedness and boosts morale.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Expectancy-Value</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Expectancy:</strong> This refers to a developer's self-efficacy
        –
        their belief in their ability to successfully complete a given task or
        project. Factors influencing expectancy include past successes,
        available
        resources, skill level, and perceived difficulty of the task.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Value:</strong> This encompasses the perceived importance and
        desirability of the task.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Intrinsic Value:</strong> The enjoyment derived from the
                task
                itself (e.g., working with a new technology).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utility Value:</strong> The perceived usefulness or
                practical
                application of the task (e.g., building a feature that directly
                benefits users).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Attainment Value:</strong> The personal significance of
                the
                task (e.g., contributing to a project that aligns with a
                developer's
                career goals).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fueling Expectancy Value</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Increase Expectancy:</strong> Break down complex tasks into
        smaller, manageable milestones; provide adequate training and resources;
        offer mentorship and support; celebrate successes to build confidence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Increase Value:</strong> Align tasks with developers' interests
        and skills; clearly communicate the impact and importance of the
        project;
        emphasize the learning opportunities; create opportunities for team
        collaboration and recognition.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Attribution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Locus of Control (Interval vs. External):</strong> Did the
        outcome
        result from the developer's actions (internal) or external factors
        (e.g.,
        unclear requirements, inadequate tools)? Internal attributions foster a
        sense of responsibility and control, boosting motivation; external
        attributions can lead to learned helplessness.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stability (Stable vs. Unstable):</strong> Is the cause of the
        outcome a persistent factor (stable) or a temporary one (unstable)?
        Attributing a failure to a stable cause (e.g., "This is just how we do
        things.") diminishes motivation. Attributing it to an unstable cause
        (e.g., "This was caused by an issue next on our priority list.") allows
        for a more optimistic outlook and future improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Controllability (Controllable vs. Uncontrollable):</strong> Can
        the developer influence the cause of the outcome? Attributing a failure
        to
        an uncontrollable factor (e.g., "This is caused by a third-party library
        we're required to use.") might be demotivating. Attributing it to a
        controllable factor (e.g., "I could have written more robust error
        handling") empowers the developer to learn and improve.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Efficacy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Mastery Experiences:</strong> Past successes in development
        significantly influence self-efficacy. Successfully completing
        challenging
        projects, debugging complex issues, or mastering new technologies boosts
        confidence and belief in future capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vicarious Experiences:</strong> Observing others succeed can
        also
        enhance self-efficacy. Regular updates from team members progress, or
        learning from successful open-source projects, inspire confidence and
        provide a roadmap for success.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Verbal Persuasion:</strong> Encouragement and positive feedback
        from mentors, colleagues, and managers strengthen self-efficacy.
        Constructive criticism focused on improvement, rather than solely on
        flaws, can positively influence a developer's belief in their ability to
        grow.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physiological States:</strong> A developer's physical and
        emotional state impacts their self-efficacy. Stress, fatigue, and
        negative
        self-talk can decrease perceived competence. Conversely, a positive
        mindset, good health, and a comfortable work environment can enhance
        self-efficacy.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fueling Self-Efficacy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Boost Mastery Experiences:</strong> Break down large projects
        into
        smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate successes, no matter how small.
        Actively seek out challenging but achievable projects that allow for
        skill
        development.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Leverage Vicarious Experiences:</strong> Attend workshops and
        conferences to learn best practices. Learn from open-source
        contributions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Seek Verbal Persuasion:</strong> Request regular feedback from
        mentors and colleagues. Actively participate in code reviews to receive
        constructive criticism.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Optimize Physiological States:</strong> Prioritize good health,
        manage stress effectively, and create a positive and comfortable work
        environment.
    </li>
</ul>
