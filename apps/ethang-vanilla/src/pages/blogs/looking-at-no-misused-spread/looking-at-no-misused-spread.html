  <h1>Looking At: no-misused-spread</h1>
  <p>
    &#64;typescript-eslint recently added a new rule
    <a
      href="https://typescripteslint.com/rules/no-misused-spread/"
      target="_blank"
      class="link"
      >no-misused-spread</a
    >. This prevents accidental use of the spread operator in unintended ways.
    From the documentation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Spreading a <span class="kbd kbd-sm">Promise</span> into an object. You
      probably meant to <span class="kbd kbd-sm">await</span> it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spreading a function without properties into an object. You probably meant
      to call it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spreading an iterable (<span class="kbd kbd-sm">Array</span>,
      <span class="kbd kbd-sm">Map</span>, etc.) into an object. Iterable
      objects usually do not have meaningful enumerable properties and you
      probably meant to spread it into an array instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spreading a string into an array. String enumeration behaviors in
      JavaScript around encoded characters are often surprising.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spreading a <span class="kbd kbd-sm">class</span> into an object. This
      copies all static own properties of the class, but none of the inheritance
      chain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spreading a class instance into an object. This does not faithfully copy
      the instance because only its own properties are copied, but the
      inheritance chain is lost, including all its methods.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before & After</h2>
  <p>
    Let's look at the before and after of incorrect usages of the spread, and
    the correct usage.
  </p>
  <p>By spreading a promise, nothing will be added to the final object:</p>
  ${ promiseExample }
  <p>
    Interestingly in the function case, TypeScript seems able to check if the
    function has properties on it. At least within the same scope:
  </p>
  ${ functionExample }
  <p>
    For spreading an iterable, this is likely a mistake. The intention is more
    likely that you want to spread it into a new array or assign its value.
  </p>
  ${ iterableExample }
  <p>
    For strings, the rule will point out the likely mistake when you try to
    spread into an array.
  </p>
  ${ stringExample }
  <p>
    When you spread a class, you will only get static properties, not even
    static methods.
  </p>
  ${ classExample }
  <p>
    And of course, the same issue happens when you spread the instance of a
    class. This, in my opinion, very important as with third-party libraries, we
    don't always know if an object is a plain object or a class instance.
  </p>
  ${ instanceExample }
</main>
