  <h1>JavaScript: The Standard Library</h1>
  <p>
    One of the most requested features for JavaScript is for a standard library.
    But what does that mean? Isn't everything on the global window object a part
    of a "standard library"?
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript provides some things like Math, Date, JSON, Intl, and fetch. But
    these are relatively limited compared to languages like Python, Java, and
    C#.
  </p>
  <p>
    What would JavaScript need to qualify as "having a standard library"? I
    don't think there is a definitive answer to this. But below is a set of
    standard, mature libraries that can help make up for where JS is lacking.
  </p>

  <h2>What makes up a standard library</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard Error Handling</strong>: An ergonomic way to handle
      errors such as via types Result&lt;T&gt;, typed returns, or a build time
      awareness of uncaught throws.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Manipulation</strong>
      : Advanced data structures such as Map, Set, Queue, Graphs, Trees, etc.,
      as well as common utilities to handle deep copying, sorting collections
      efficiently, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time and Date Handling</strong>
      : Full support for data and time with timezones as well as utilities to
      handle calendars.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: Standardized APIs for sockets, WebSockets,
      and HTTP.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Concurrency/Asynchrony</strong>: High-level abstractions for
      managing async workflows. (event emitters, task queues, worker threads)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>String and Regular Expression Utilities</strong>: Built-in
      utilities for efficient manipulation of strings or pattern matching.
      Standardized functions for natural language processing (tokenization,
      stemming, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web APIs</strong>: Common utilities for URL parsing, query
      strings, encoding/decoding structured data types.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mathematics and Randomness</strong>: Support for working with
      vectors, matrices, and general numeric computing. As well as PRNG utilities
      for reproducible randomness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>File I/O</strong>: Methods to write files directly, available for
      browser environments and server-side. The browser File System API has
      limited user interaction, limited scope, limited file metadata, no support
      for watching directories, batch file management, symlinks, file locks, or
      any standard API to handle remote files. (FTP, HTTP, S3, etc.). The node
      fs module has inconsistent platform handling, higher level abstractions
      for temporary directories, atomic writes and retry mechanism are missing.
      It also has no standard interface to handle remote files and no built-in
      compression.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cryptography</strong>: Standardized, secure solution for hashing,
      encryption, and public/private key operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>OS Level Control</strong>: Access to environment variables,
      parallel threads (with robust abstractions), process management.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Libraries</h2>

    <strong

    >
    Safely and elegantly handle JS type coercion without throws. Functional
    error handling. Deep object cloning. Collection handling. Functional methods
    such as flow (pipe pattern). Complex string manipulation such as casing and
    HTML escape.

    are that it only supports the user's local time and UTC, and there's no time
    zone support. Additionally, its parsing behavior is very unreliable, and
    Date itself is mutable, which can introduce hard-to-trace bugs. There are
    other problems like calculations across Daylight Saving Time (DST) and
    historical calendar changes, which are notoriously difficult to work with."
