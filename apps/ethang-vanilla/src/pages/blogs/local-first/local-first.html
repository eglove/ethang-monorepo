  <h1>The Local First Stack</h1>
  <p>
    Through a recent side project, I realized how comfortable my workflow has
    become. And it's not by using a service like Firebase, Supabase, Convex,
    Vercel, or even a full-stack framework like Next.js. It's by building a
    system that works for me.

    The project starts with a frontend with TanStack Router. I see no need for
    TanStack Start, and I think working with it starts to introduce unimportant
    opinions. Router is exactly what I need to get going for a React app.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to UI component libraries, I've used Shadcn, and it's fine,
    but too minimal. It's also too opinionated when it comes to the libraries it
    introduces to a code base. By using react-hook-form and TanStack Table and
    forcing my hand when I want to use something else down the road. I could
    install both, but that gets very messy in terms of dependency management.
  </p>
  <p>
    As opposed to TanStack Table, I'd rather use server side filtering and
    pagination or just TansStack Query. This gives far better performance than
    trying to work with all data on every render.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, I go to the tried and true HeroUI. It's complete, mature, easy to
    use and themeable. Its form components integrate very well with TanStack
    Form.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to validating forms, I stick with Zod, keeping schemas in a
    separate package on my monorepo so they can be used on both frontend and
    backend services.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we get to data, there's nothing better than TanStack Query. Treating
    the results of async calls as a synchronous store. This pairs very well with
    IDB, sets up an environment where custom middlewares can be written.
  </p>
  <p>
    For local state management, I much prefer my own store. I like the DX of
    TanStack Store, it's very much an inspiration for my own. But my own is
    built to work with vanilla/refs, and make use of immer. I love being able to
    grab current state out of a store in any function without tricks. And simple
    render function sync via useSyncExternalStore. Why would you ever want
    anything else from local stage management?
  </p>
  <p>
    On auth, I appreciate what Clerk does. As well as Auth.js. But all I need is
    a rest API to work with JWT tokens and verification. Custom components are
    nice, but not necessary. I feel like the basics get lost with a lot of Auth
    libraries and packages. I wrote my own auth service to sign up and verify
    auth headers without the headache of having to learn a complex library for a
    very simple function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Syncing data. This is the part I most feared about building a local first
    app. All the scary talk about object sync engines. I thought about using
    Dexie Cloud for this project but wondered how I'd be able to call into that
    data from other backend services down the line. As well as other features I
    needed. I decided stressing about implementing my own features first
    outweighed the cost of figuring out how to deal with third-party
    integrations.
  </p>
  <p>
    But by simply writing a Cloudflare Worker with a D1 database, I found it was
    easy to add synchronization methods into the already existing IDB queries I
    have on the frontend. I can get more complex with the sync, but for now it
    seems reasonable to make a few simplifications.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>All mutations/changes are also sent to the backup service.</li>
    <li>
      If the user imports data from a saved file, it appends backend data but
      does not delete.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the user imports cloud data, it appends local data but does not delete.
    </li>
    <li>
      If queries return empty data, they attempt to get the backed-up data from
      the backup service.
    </li>
    <li>All local data is synced to the backup service on reconnect.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These simple rules give users enough control to avoid most issues with data
    conflicts, provide the performance of local first, and keep good backups.
