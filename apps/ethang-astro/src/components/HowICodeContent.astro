 * TODO add sections on:

 * Storybook as a frontend testing framework
 * Prisma as the best ORM, and why you should use ORMs
 * Mention playwright as the best E2E tool
 * Why you should use JetBrains IDE's over the trend chase text editors (Sublime - customization/themes, VS Code - plugins, Cursor - AI)
 * Documentation should never be used to explain how to work on something. It should only ever be used to explain how to use something. If documentation is the only form of onboarding a team has, it suggests other problems. Every developer knows how to start a project and read code. But other teams may need a simple definition of APIs and schemas. Data contracts are many times more important than documentation. (Add if you follow everything above, testing, linting, etc. this is even more true as these will act as a true living documentation. It is impossible to do this via Jira or Google Docs, the term "living documentation" is being used incorrectly here, it is by definition dead.

    <h2 id="javaScriptIsNotAProgrammingLanguage">
      JavaScript Is Not a Programming Language
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we talk about web development, JavaScript is undeniably at the core
      of nearly everything interactive we see online. It's the language that
      makes pages dynamic, handles user input, and powers complex web
      applications. But despite its pervasive influence and incredible
      capabilities, let's challenge a common perception: is JavaScript truly a
      "programming language" in the same vein as C++, Java, or Python, or is it
      something else entirely—a highly effective scripting language that acts as
      an API to more robust, lower-level systems?
    </p>
    <h3 id="javascriptAsTheUltimateApi">JavaScript as the Ultimate API</h3>
    <p>
      Think about it: what does JavaScript do? In a browser environment, it
      manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM), fetches data, responds to
      events, and interacts with various Web APIs like <code>localStorage</code
      >,
      <code>fetch</code>, or <code>WebGL</code>. You can think of it as the
      conductor of an orchestra, but the instruments themselves—the browser's
      rendering engine, the network stack, the underlying operating system—are
      built using languages like C++, Rust, or assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this perspective, JavaScript functions less like a foundational
      programming language and more like a powerful scripting interface. It's
      the language we use to tell the browser (which is itself a complex
      application written in low-level languages) what to do. Consider it as an
      API, a set of commands and conventions, that allows you to interact with
      the browser's core functionalities. Robust programming languages typically
      provide their own comprehensive set of tools and direct control over
      system resources; JavaScript, by design, largely abstracts this away,
      operating within the confines of its host environment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theMissingStandardLibrary">
      The Missing Standard Library: A Key Indicator
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the strongest arguments for viewing JavaScript this way is its
      inherent lack of a comprehensive standard library. What is a "standard
      library"? It's a collection of pre-built functions, modules, and data
      structures that come bundled with a programming language, providing common
      functionalities like file system access, networking, advanced data
      manipulation, or date/time utilities. Looking at other languages, you'll
      notice that Python has a vast standard library, Java has its rich API, and
      even C++ has a well-defined standard library.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript? Not so much. When working on a project, if you need robust
      date manipulation, you'll reach for
      <code>luxon</code>. If you need utility functions for arrays or objects,
      you might consider
      <code>lodash</code>. For proper async management, <code
        >@tanstack/query</code
      > becomes essential. These are covered in "<a
        href="https://ethang.dev/blog/javascript-standard-library/"
        target="_blank">Why You Should Install That JS Library</a
      >," which acts as a testament to this reality. Developers <i>rely</i> on the
      vast ecosystem of NPM packages precisely because core JavaScript doesn't natively
      provide many of these essential functionalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reliance on third-party packages, while incredibly powerful and
      flexible, highlights that JavaScript itself doesn't offer the
      self-contained, batteries-included environment we associate with
      traditional programming languages. From practical experience, it needs to
      be <i>supplemented</i>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theInevitableSupplementation">The Inevitable Supplementation</h3>
    <p>
      This brings us to the core reason why JavaScript, in its most effective
      forms, must always be supplemented by other "programming language"
      paradigms or tools:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Backend Logic and Templating:</strong> Historically and still frequently,
        complex application logic, database interactions, and server-side templating
        are handled by backend programming languages like Python (Django, Flask),
        Ruby (Rails), Java (Spring), or Node.js (which, while using JavaScript syntax,
        operates on a runtime environment like V8, which is written in C++). These
        languages are designed for robust data processing, security, and managing
        persistent state outside the client's browser. JavaScript on the frontend
        acts as the interface, displaying data and sending requests to these more
        robust backend systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >The "Modern JS Ecosystem": A Programming Language Stack in Disguise:</strong
        > The rise of TypeScript and powerful bundlers like Vite, Webpack, and Parcel
        further reinforces this idea.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>TypeScript:</strong> This isn't just "JavaScript with types."
            It's a superset that compiles down to JavaScript, introducing static
            typing, interfaces, enums, and other features common in strongly-typed
            programming languages. We use TypeScript to bring robustness, scalability,
            and maintainability—qualities often lacking in pure, untyped JavaScript
            for large projects. It's almost like we're building a more robust "programming
            language" on top of JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Parcel):</strong> These tools transform,
            optimize, and combine our JavaScript, CSS, and other assets. They handle
            module resolution, transpilation (converting modern JavaScript to older
            versions for browser compatibility), code splitting, and more. While
            they work with JavaScript, they are complex applications themselves,
            often written in lower-level languages or leveraging Node.js APIs, and
            are essential for delivering performant and production-ready web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NPM Packages:</strong> As mentioned, the sheer volume and necessity
            of NPM packages for common tasks underscore JavaScript's reliance on
            external modules to fill the gaps that a comprehensive standard library
            would typically address. These packages collectively form a de-facto,
            community-driven "standard library," but it's not inherent to the language
            itself.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beyond "Vanilla JS" for Production Apps:</strong>
        A common misconception is that modern production-grade web applications can
        be built with "pure vanilla JavaScript." This often stems from a perspective
        where a backend language handles all the "real programming" and HTML templating,
        with JavaScript playing a minimal, decorative role. However, for any production
        application aiming for a rich, interactive, and maintainable user experience,
        "pure vanilla JavaScript" is simply not a viable option.
        <br />
        You essentially have two primary paths to build a robust web application,
        and both involve significant supplementation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Path A: Embrace the Modern JavaScript Ecosystem:</strong> This
            involves leveraging tools like TypeScript for type safety and scalability,
            JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) for component-based architecture
            and efficient UI updates, and the vast NPM ecosystem for libraries that
            fill the gaps of JavaScript's non-existent standard library. Bundlers
            like Vite or Webpack are then crucial for optimizing and packaging your
            client-side code for deployment. In this scenario, JavaScript (or TypeScript)
            is doing a significant amount of the "programming" on the client-side,
            managing complex UI states, handling routing, and making asynchronous
            API calls.
          </li>
          <li>

              >Path B: Rely on a Backend Programming Language and its Ecosystem:</strong
            > In this approach, a backend language (e.g., Python with Django/Flask,
            Ruby with Rails, Java with Spring, PHP with Laravel) takes on the primary
            role of generating HTML templates, managing server-side logic, database
            interactions, and authentication. Client-side JavaScript's role might
            be limited to small, isolated interactive elements or form validations.
            Here, the "real programming" for the application's core logic and structure
            is handled by the backend language and its comprehensive frameworks and
            libraries, effectively serving in place of the modern JavaScript ecosystem
            for much of the application's functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        There is <strong>never</strong> a case where a production-ready application
        can be built solely with "pure vanilla JavaScript" without any form of supplementation
        from either a robust backend programming language or the modern JavaScript
        ecosystem. The demands of performance, scalability, maintainability, and
        user experience in today's web necessitate the structure, tools, and libraries
        that these ecosystems provide.

    <h3 id="isJavaScriptNotAProgrammingLanguage">
      So, Is JavaScript "Not a Programming Language" Then?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The argument isn't that JavaScript is "bad" or "incapable." Far from it!
      It's incredibly powerful and has revolutionized the web. The distinction
      being drawn is one of fundamental design and role.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's more accurate to view JavaScript as an extraordinarily versatile and
      high-level scripting language, purpose-built for interacting with and
      manipulating web environments. It excels as an API layer, allowing
      developers to orchestrate complex user experiences. However, for the
      underlying heavy lifting, the foundational system interactions, and the
      robust structuring of large-scale applications, JavaScript frequently
      leans on or necessitates the support of environments and tools that are
      themselves built upon or emulate the characteristics of traditional
      programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This perspective helps you appreciate JavaScript for what it is: an
      incredibly effective, adaptable, and indispensable scripting interface
      that, when combined with its powerful ecosystem, enables the creation of
      dynamic and interactive web experiences we know and love. You can see it
      as a language that thrives on collaboration—with browsers, with backend
      systems, and with its ever-expanding universe of tools and libraries. And
      in that, there's a unique beauty and strength.

      TypeScript Is An Additional Layer of Protection, Not a Replacement
    </h2>
    <p>
      TypeScript is a powerful tool, catching errors early and boosting
      productivity. When combining it with runtime validation libraries like
      Zod, developers often establish robust data contracts at application
      boundaries. This can lead to a common assumption: once data passes these
      initial checks, it's "safe" and needs no further runtime scrutiny. This
      section challenges that notion, exploring the crucial distinction between
      build-time and runtime type checks and emphasizing why comprehensive
      testing for runtime edge cases remains essential, even in a meticulously
      validated TypeScript codebase.
    </p>
    <h3 id="buildTimeVsRuntime">
      Build-Time vs. Runtime Type Checks: A Fundamental Difference
    </h3>
    <p>
      Build-time type checks are TypeScript's domain. They happen during
      compilation, before your code ever runs. TypeScript analyzes code,
      inferring types, and flags mismatches based on annotations. If a function
      expects numbers but gets a string, TypeScript stops the process,
      preventing compilation until it's fixed. This static analysis is
      incredibly powerful for early bug detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it's important to emphasize this critical point: TypeScript's
      types are erased when code compiles to plain JavaScript. At runtime, the
      application executes dynamic JavaScript. TypeScript ensures type safety
      during development, but it offers no inherent guarantees about the data
      your application will encounter live. The compiled JavaScript simply runs
      based on the values present at that moment, stripped of any TypeScript
      type information.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theMisconceptionOnceValidated">
      The Misconception: "Once Validated, Always Safe"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many developers, especially those using TypeScript with runtime validation
      libraries like Zod, assume that data, once validated at entry points
      (e.g., API requests, form submissions), is perfectly typed and "safe"
      throughout its journey. This often leads to the belief that internal
      functions, having received Zod-validated data, no longer need defensive
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      While understandable, this perspective overlooks a crucial reality: data
      can become "untyped" or unexpectedly malformed after initial validation.
      Internal transformations, coercions, or complex state changes can
      introduce issues. Even data that's perfectly valid at the boundary can
      cause runtime problems if the internal logic doesn't account for
      JavaScript's dynamic nature.
    </p>
    <h3 id="whyRuntimeEdgeCasesMatter">
      Why Runtime Edge Cases Matter (Even for "Safe" Data)
    </h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript's dynamic nature means that even with TypeScript and initial
      validation, your code can encounter "garbage" data or unexpected states
      that static checks and initial runtime validators simply can't foresee in
      all internal contexts. TypeScript operates on assumptions about code
      structure, and Zod validates a snapshot of data. Neither guarantees data
      integrity throughout its entire lifecycle. Here's how data can still lead
      to runtime issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>NaN</code>
        <strong>(Not-A-Number):</strong> A numeric field might pass Zod validation,
        but subsequent arithmetic (e.g., division by zero, internal string parsing)
        can introduce <code>NaN</code>. TypeScript still sees a <code
          >number</code
        >, but <code>NaN</code> propagates silently, leading to incorrect results
        or unpredictable behavior if unchecked.
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
// Example: NaN propagation that TypeScript won't catch
function calculateAverage(values: number[]): number {
  // TypeScript is happy with this function's type safety
  const sum = values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  const avg = sum / values.length; // This can be NaN if values.length is 0
  return avg;
}

// This passes TypeScript checks but produces NaN at runtime
const emptyArray: number[] = [];
const average = calculateAverage(emptyArray); // NaN
console.log(average); // NaN

// NaN then silently propagates through further calculations
const doubledAverage = average * 2; // NaN
console.log(doubledAverage); // NaN`}

        > TypeScript is excellent at identifying optional properties (e.g., <code

          >undefined</code
        >
        can still appear unexpectedly where we might assume a value exists due to
        prior logic or transformations. This often happens as systems scale, and
        data flows through multiple layers, merges, or default assignments. A developer
        might overlook a potential <code>undefined</code> in a deeply nested or conditionally
        assigned property, leading to runtime errors.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empty Values:</strong> An array or string might pass Zod validation
        as present and typed correctly, but subsequent filtering, mapping, or string
        manipulation can result in an empty array (<code>[]</code>) or empty
        string (<code>""</code>). Logic expecting content (e.g., iterating,
        parsing) might break or yield unintended results if these empty values
        aren't handled in internal functions.

      <li>
        <strong>JavaScript's Automatic Coercions:</strong> Despite TypeScript, JavaScript's
        flexible type coercion rules can lead to surprising behavior within our application.
        If a <code>number</code> is implicitly concatenated with a <code
          >string</code
        > deep in our logic (<code>someNumber + ""</code>), it becomes a string.
        If a subsequent function expects a number, this hidden coercion can
        cause unexpected runtime outcomes not caught by static analysis.
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
// Example: Automatic coercion that TypeScript won't catch
function calculateTotal(price: number, quantity: number): number {
  return price * quantity;
}

// This function gets data from a form or API and returns numbers
function getOrderData(): { price: number; quantity: number } {
  // In a real app, this might come from form inputs or API responses
  // where values might be strings that get parsed to numbers

  // Imagine this is from an HTML input with type="number"
  // Even with input type="number", values come as strings from forms
  const priceFromForm = "10";
  const quantityFromForm = "5";

  // Implicit coercion happens here - the + operator converts strings to numbers
  // TypeScript doesn't catch this because the return type matches
  return {
    price: +priceFromForm,     // Correct conversion
    quantity: quantityFromForm as unknown as number  // Incorrect - string passed as number
  };
}

const { price, quantity } = getOrderData();

// JavaScript will coerce the string to a number during multiplication
const total = calculateTotal(price, quantity);
console.log(total); // 50 - works by coincidence

// But what if the form data was invalid?
function getInvalidOrderData(): { price: number; quantity: number } {
  const priceFromForm = "10";
  const quantityFromForm = "five"; // Invalid input

  return {
    price: +priceFromForm,
    quantity: quantityFromForm as unknown as number // This bypasses TypeScript's checks
  };
}

const invalidOrder = getInvalidOrderData();
// This compiles fine but fails at runtime
const invalidTotal = calculateTotal(invalidOrder.price, invalidOrder.quantity);
console.log(invalidTotal); // NaN`}
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Native Methods with Undocumented Throws:</strong> Many native JavaScript
        methods can throw errors under specific, sometimes poorly documented, conditions.
        For instance, certain string or array methods might throw if called on <code
          >null</code
        > or <code>undefined</code>, even if prior code seemed to ensure a valid
        type. TypeScript doesn't predict or prevent these runtime exceptions,
        making testing crucial.
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
// Example: Native method throwing on unexpected input
function parseJsonString(jsonString: string) {
  // Assume jsonString is validated by Zod as a string
  // But what if an internal process passes an invalid JSON string?
  try {
    return JSON.parse(jsonString);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Failed to parse JSON:", e);
    // Handle gracefully, e.g., return a default object or null
    return null;

parseJsonString('invalid json'); // Throws SyntaxError, caught by try/catch`}

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The notion that internal code is immune to these issues is a misdirection.
      If a function, even deep within an application, can receive input that
      causes it to crash or behave unpredictably, it is ultimately the
      responsibility of developers to gracefully handle that input. A robust
      application anticipates and mitigates such scenarios. Real-world examples,
      like a financial dashboard displaying incorrect calculations due to
      unhandled <code>NaN</code>s introduced during internal data processing, or
      an e-commerce platform failing to process orders because of missing object
      properties after complex data transformations, vividly underscore this
      point. In these scenarios, failures stem not from initial external data
      validation, but from runtime data integrity issues within the
      application's core logic.

    <h3 id="implementingRobustRuntime">
      Implementing Robust Runtime Checks (Beyond the Boundary)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since TypeScript's static checks are removed at runtime, and initial
      validation only covers the entry point, consciously implementing robust
      runtime validation within your application becomes essential. This
      involves several practical approaches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Leveraging TypeScript's Type Guards and Assertion Functions:</strong
        > Within a TypeScript codebase, you can write custom <a

          target="_blank">type guards</a
        > or <a
          href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#assertion-functions"
          target="_blank">assertion functions</a
        > to perform runtime checks and inform the TypeScript compiler about a variable's
        type after the check. This allows you to combine dynamic runtime safety with
        static type inference. For example:
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}

function processInput(input: unknown) {
  if (isString(input)) {
    // TypeScript now knows 'input' is a string here
    console.log(input.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    console.error("Input was not a string!");
  }
}
`}
        />
        Or better yet, use lodash which also accounts for new String().
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
function isString(value) {
    const type = typeof value;
    return (
        type === 'string' ||
        (type === 'object' &&
            value != null &&
            !Array.isArray(value) &&
            getTag(value) === '[object String]')
    );
}`}
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adopting Defensive Programming Patterns:</strong> Basic JavaScript
        checks remain powerful. Explicitly check for <code>typeof</code>, <code
          >instanceof</code
        >, <code>Array.isArray()</code>, <code
          >Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()</code
        >, and other conditions directly within our functions, especially those
        that are critical, complex, or highly reused. This ensures that even if
        a value unexpectedly deviates from its expected type or structure, our
        code can handle it gracefully.
        <CodeBlock
          code={`
// Example: Processing a string defensively
function processUserName(name: string | null | undefined): string {
  if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.trim() === '') {
    console.warn("Invalid or empty user name provided. Using default.");
    return "Guest"; // Provide a safe default or throw a specific error
  }
  return name.trim().toUpperCase();
}

console.log(processUserName("  Alice  ")); // "ALICE"
console.log(processUserName(null));       // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(undefined));  // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(""));         // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(123 as any)); // Warns, "Guest"`}
        />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="strategicValidation">Strategic Validation: Where and How Much?</h3>
    <p>
      Where you place runtime validation is crucial. While "entry point
      validation" — validating data as it first enters your application (e.g.,
      at an API gateway, a serverless function handler, or a form submission
      endpoint) — is paramount, it's not the only place to consider.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Application Boundaries:</strong> This is the primary layer for comprehensive
        validation using schema libraries like Zod. Here, ensure all external inputs
        meet your application's fundamental data contracts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service or Business Logic Layers:</strong> Even after initial validation,
        data might be transformed or composed internally. Robust services or core
        business logic functions, especially those handling critical operations or
        consuming data from multiple internal sources, should include internal defensive
        checks to ensure data integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Utility Functions:</strong> As seen with lodash, generic utility
        functions benefit immensely from being highly defensive. They should be resilient
        to a wide range of inputs, as they are often reused across many contexts
        and may receive data that has undergone various transformations or subtle
        coercions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key is balance. Validate thoroughly at the boundaries of untrusted
      data, but also implement targeted, defensive checks within core logic and
      reusable components to ensure their robustness and predictable behavior.
    </p>
    <h3 id="testingForRuntimeEdgeCases">Testing for Runtime Edge Cases</h3>
    <p>
      This brings us to the crucial role of runtime testing. While TypeScript
      ensures code adheres to its defined types during development, and Zod
      validates at the entry point, tests are needed to verify how your code
      behaves when confronted with data that doesn't conform to those ideal
      types at runtime within your application's internal flow, or when it
      encounters other unexpected conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider how a robust utility library like lodash approaches this. For a
      function like <code>get(object, path, [defaultValue])</code>, which safely
      retrieves a value at a given <code>path</code> from
      <code>object</code>, its tests don't just cover the "happy path" where <code
        >object</code
      > and
      <code>path</code> are perfectly valid. Instead, lodash's extensive test suite
      includes scenarios where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>object</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, a
        number, a string, or a boolean, rather than an object, possibly due to a
        prior transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>path</code> is an empty string, an array containing <code
          >null</code
        > or <code>undefined</code>
        elements, a non-existent path, or a path that leads to a non-object value
        where further traversal is attempted, even if the initial <code
          >object</code
        > was validated.
      </li>
      <li>The function is called with too few or too many arguments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These tests reveal how <code>get</code> gracefully handles various invalid
      inputs, typically returning <code>undefined</code>
      (or the specified <code>defaultValue</code>) rather than throwing an error
      or crashing the application. This meticulous approach to testing for
      runtime resilience is a hallmark of well-engineered code. Such runtime
      checks, combined with TypeScript's compile-time safety, create a layered
      defense against errors, ensuring your application remains stable even when
      confronted with imperfect data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, relying solely on "entry point validation" isn't sufficient
      for complex applications if internal components are brittle. Unit tests
      that probe these edge cases ensure that individual "units" of code are
      resilient, regardless of where their data originates. Libraries like
      lodash are prime examples of this philosophy, with extensive tests
      dedicated to covering every conceivable edge case for their utility
      functions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="typescriptsRoleConclusion">TypeScript's Role: A Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      TypeScript is an invaluable asset for modern JavaScript development,
      providing strong type guarantees at build time that significantly reduce
      common programming errors. When combined with powerful runtime validation
      libraries like Zod, it creates a formidable first line of defense.
      However, this combination is not a silver bullet that eliminates the need
      for further runtime validation and comprehensive testing within your
      application's internal logic. JavaScript's dynamic nature means that
      unexpected data and edge cases can still arise during execution, even with
      initially "safe" data.
    </p>
    <p>
      True engineering involves understanding both the static safety provided by
      TypeScript and the dynamic realities of JavaScript. By embracing robust
      runtime checks—through TypeScript's type guards, defensive programming
      patterns, and strategic use of validation where data transformations
      occur—and rigorously testing for edge cases, you can build applications
      that are not only type-safe but also resilient, graceful, and truly robust
      in the face of real-world data. This layered approach leads to improved
      user experience by preventing unexpected errors, easier debugging and
      maintenance due to predictable behavior, and ultimately, enhanced system
      reliability and security. It's about building code that works reliably,
      even when the "unhappy path" presents itself within your codebase.

    <h2 id="waitYouStillUseLodash">Wait, You Still Use lodash?</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding why lodash remains valuable is key to understanding a robust
      approach to building with TypeScript. In an era where "You Might Not Need
      Lodash" is a common refrain and modern JavaScript has adopted many
      utility-like features, sticking with a library like lodash might seem
      anachronistic. However, relying on lodash, particularly functions like <code
        >get</code
      >, <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>isEqual</code>, and its collection
      manipulation utilities, stems from a deep appreciation for its
      battle-tested robustness and comprehensive handling of edge
      cases—qualities that are often underestimated or poorly replicated in
      custom implementations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="thePerilsOfRollingYourOwn">The Perils of "Rolling Your Own"</h3>
    <p>
      The argument that one can easily replicate lodash functions with a few
      lines of native JavaScript often overlooks the sheer number of edge cases
      and nuances that a library like lodash has been engineered to handle over
      years of widespread use. Consider a seemingly simple function like <code
        >get(object, path, defaultValue)</code
      >. A naive custom implementation might look something like this:
    </p>
    <CodeBlock
      code={`
function customGet(obj, path, defaultValue) {
  const keys = Array.isArray(path) ? path : path.split('.');
  let result = obj;
  for (const key of keys) {
    if (result && typeof result === 'object' && key in result) {
      result = result[key];
    } else {
      return defaultValue;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
`}
    />
    <p>
      This custom <code>get</code> might work for straightforward cases. However,
      it quickly falls apart when faced with the myriad of scenarios lodash's <code
        >get</code
      > handles gracefully:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Null or Undefined Objects/Paths:</strong> What if <code
          >obj</code
        > is <code>null</code> or
        <code>undefined</code>? What if <code>path</code> is <code>null</code>, <code
          >undefined</code
        >, or an empty string/array? lodash handles these without throwing
        errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-Object Values in Path:</strong> What if an intermediate key in
        the path points to a primitive value (e.g., <code>a.b.c</code> where <code
          >b</code
        > is a number)? Custom solutions often fail or throw errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Array Paths with Non-String Keys:</strong> lodash's <code
          >get</code
        > can handle paths like
        <code>['a', 0, 'b']</code> correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          ><code>__proto__</code> or <code>constructor</code> in Path:</strong
        > lodash specifically guards against prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance:</strong> lodash functions are often highly optimized.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As I talk about in, "<a href="/blog/your-lodash-get-implementation-sucks"
        >Your lodash.get implementation Sucks</a
      >," creating a truly robust equivalent to <code>get</code> that covers all
      these edge cases is a non-trivial task. Developers often underestimate this
      complexity, leading to buggy, unreliable utility functions that introduce subtle
      issues into their applications. The time and effort spent reinventing and debugging
      these wheels is rarely a good investment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theEdgeCaseGauntlet">The Edge Case Gauntlet: Why lodash Wins</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://utility.hello-a8f.workers.dev/#/" target="_blank"
        >This vitest report</a
      > comparing lodash, es-toolkit, Remeda, and snippets from "You Might Not Need
      Lodash" provides compelling evidence of this. The report systematically tests
      various utility functions against a battery of edge cases. Time and again,
      lodash demonstrates superior coverage. While newer libraries or native JavaScript
      features might cover the "happy path" and some common edge cases, lodash consistently
      handles the more obscure, yet critical, scenarios that can lead to unexpected
      runtime failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider <code>isEmpty</code>. It correctly identifies not
      just empty objects (<code>{}</code>), arrays (<code>[]</code>), and
      strings (<code>""</code>) as empty, but also <code>null</code>,
      <code>undefined</code>,
      <code>NaN</code>, empty <code>Map</code>s, empty <code>Set</code>s, and
      even
      <code>arguments</code> objects with no arguments. Replicating this breadth
      of coverage accurately is surprisingly difficult. Similarly,<code
        >isEqual</code
      > performs deep comparisons, handling circular references and comparing a wide
      variety of types correctly—a task notoriously difficult to implement flawlessly
      from scratch.
    </p>
    <h3 id="typescriptDoesntEliminateRuntime">
      TypeScript Doesn't Eliminate Runtime Realities
    </h3>
    <p>
      One might argue that TypeScript's static type checking reduces the need
      for such robust runtime handling. While TypeScript is invaluable, as
      discussed in the previous section, it doesn't eliminate runtime
      uncertainties. Data can still come from external APIs with unexpected
      shapes, undergo transformations that subtly alter its structure, or
      encounter JavaScript's own type coercion quirks.
    </p>
    <p>
      lodash functions act as a hardened layer of defense at runtime. They are
      designed with the understanding that JavaScript is dynamic and that data
      can be unpredictable. When I use <code
        >get(user, ['profile', 'street', 'address.1'])</code
      >, I have 100% confidence that it will not throw an error if
      <code>user</code>, <code>profile</code>, or <code>address.1</code> is <code
        >null</code
      > or
      <code>undefined</code>, or if <code>street</code> doesn't exist. It will simply
      return undefined (or the provided default value), allowing my application to
      proceed gracefully. This predictability is immensely valuable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="focusingOnBusinessLogic">
      Focusing on Business Logic, Not Utility Plumbing
    </h3>
    <p>
      By relying on lodash, I can focus my development efforts on the unique
      business logic of my application, rather than getting bogged down in the
      minutiae of writing and debugging low-level utility functions. The
      developers behind lodash have already invested thousands of hours into
      perfecting these utilities, testing them against countless scenarios, and
      optimizing them for performance. Leveraging their expertise is a pragmatic
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it's true that tree-shaking can mitigate the bundle size impact of
      including lodash (especially when importing individual functions like <code
        >import get from 'lodash/get'</code
      >), the primary benefit isn't just about bundle size; it's about
      reliability, developer productivity, and reducing the surface area for
      bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, my continued use of lodash in a TypeScript world is a
      conscious decision rooted in a pragmatic approach to software engineering.
      It's about valuing battle-tested robustness, comprehensive edge-case
      handling, and the ability to focus on higher-level concerns, knowing that
      the foundational utility layer is solid and reliable. The cost of a poorly
      implemented custom utility is often far greater than the perceived
      overhead of using a well-established library.

    <h2 id="unitTestingAndTdd">
      Unit Testing and TDD: Engineering for Reusability and Resilience
    </h2>
    <p>
      The principles discussed so far—the need for robust runtime checks even
      with TypeScript, and the value of battle-tested utilities like
      lodash—converge on a broader philosophy of software engineering: building
      for resilience and reusability. This naturally leads us to the
      indispensable practice of unit testing, and more specifically, Test-Driven
      Development (TDD).
    </p>
    <h3 id="theE2EFallacy">The E2E Fallacy: "If it Works, It's Good"</h3>
    <p>
      There's a common misconception, particularly in teams that prioritize
      rapid feature delivery, that comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) tests are
      sufficient. The thinking goes: "If the user can click through the
      application and achieve their goal, then the underlying code must be
      working correctly." While E2E tests are crucial for validating user flows
      and integration points, relying on them solely is a shortcut that often
      signals a lack of deeper engineering discipline. This approach
      fundamentally misunderstands a key goal of good software: reusability.
    </p>
    <p>
      E2E tests primarily confirm that a specific pathway through the
      application behaves as expected at that moment. They do little to
      guarantee that the individual components, functions, or modules ("units")
      that make up that pathway are independently robust, correct across a range
      of inputs, or easily reusable in other contexts. Code that "just works"
      for E2E scenarios might be brittle, riddled with hidden dependencies, or
      prone to breaking when its internal logic is slightly perturbed or when
      it's leveraged elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h3 id="unitTestsForgingReusable">
      Unit Tests: Forging Reusable, Reliable Components
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unit testing forces you to think about code in terms of isolated,
      well-defined units with clear inputs and outputs. Each unit test verifies
      that a specific piece of code (a function, a method, a class) behaves
      correctly for a given set of inputs, including edge cases and invalid
      data. This is precisely the same discipline that makes libraries like
      lodash so valuable. Lodash functions are reliable because they are, in
      essence, collections of extremely well-unit-tested pieces of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the arguments for using lodash even when data is validated at
      application boundaries: internal transformations can still introduce
      unexpected data, and JavaScript's dynamic nature can lead to subtle bugs.
      The same logic applies to your own code. A function that receives data,
      even if that data was validated by Zod at an API endpoint, might perform
      internal operations that could lead to errors if not handled correctly.
      Unit tests for that function ensure it is resilient to these internal
      variations and potential misuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing unit tests, you're not just checking for correctness; you're:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Designing for Testability:</strong> This often leads to better-designed
        code—more modular, with fewer side effects, and clearer interfaces. Code
        that is hard to unit test is often a sign of poor design.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Documenting Behavior:</strong> Unit tests serve as executable documentation,
        clearly demonstrating how a unit of code is intended to be used and how it
        behaves under various conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enabling Safe Refactoring:</strong> A comprehensive suite of unit
        tests gives you the confidence to refactor and improve code, knowing that
        if you break existing functionality, the tests will catch it immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Isolating Failures:</strong> When a unit test fails, it points directly
        to the specific unit of code that has a problem, making debugging significantly
        faster and more efficient than trying to diagnose a failure in a complex
        E2E test.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="testDrivenDevelopment">
      Test-Driven Development (TDD): Building Quality In
    </h3>
    <p>
      Test-Driven Development takes this a step further by advocating writing
      tests before writing the implementation code. Think of the TDD cycle as
      "Red-Green-Refactor":
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Red:</strong> Write a failing unit test that defines a small piece
        of desired functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Green:</strong> Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make
        the test pass.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Refactor:</strong> Improve the code (e.g., for clarity, performance,
        removing duplication) while ensuring all tests still pass.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      TDD is not just a testing technique; it's a design methodology. By
      thinking about the requirements and edge cases from the perspective of a
      test first, you're forced to design your code with clarity, testability,
      and correctness in mind from the outset. It encourages building small,
      focused units of functionality that are inherently robust.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theCumulativeEffect">The Cumulative Effect: System Resilience</h3>
    <p>
      Just as a single, poorly implemented utility function can introduce
      subtle, cascading bugs throughout a system, a collection of
      well-unit-tested components contributes to overall system resilience. When
      individual units are known to be reliable across a wide range of inputs
      and edge cases, the likelihood of unexpected interactions and failures at
      a higher level decreases significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a function is used in multiple places, and its behavior subtly changes
      or breaks due to an untested edge case, the impact can propagate
      throughout the application. This is where the "shortcut" of relying only
      on E2E tests becomes particularly dangerous. An E2E test might only cover
      one specific path through that function, leaving other usages vulnerable.
      Thorough unit testing, especially when guided by TDD, ensures that each
      unit is a solid building block, contributing to a more stable and
      maintainable system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument isn't to abandon E2E tests—they serve a vital purpose.
      Rather, it's to emphasize that unit testing is a foundational engineering
      practice essential for building high-quality, reusable, and resilient
      software. It's about applying the same rigor to our own code that we
      expect from well-regarded libraries, ensuring that each piece, no matter
      how small, is engineered to be dependable. This disciplined approach is a
      hallmark of true software engineering, moving beyond simply making things
      "work" to making them work reliably and sustainably.

      The Indispensable Role of End-to-End (E2E) Testing
    </h2>
    <p>
      While unit tests are foundational for ensuring the reliability and
      reusability of individual components, End-to-End (E2E) tests play a
      distinct, yet equally crucial, role in the software quality assurance
      spectrum. They are not a replacement for unit tests, by any stretch of the
      imagination, but rather a complementary practice that validates the
      application from a different, higher-level perspective.

    <h3 id="e2eTestsValidating">
      E2E Tests: Validating the Entire User Journey
    </h3>
    <p>
      E2E tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. They interact
      with the application through its UI, just as a user would, clicking
      buttons, filling out forms, navigating between pages, and verifying that
      the entire integrated system behaves as expected. This means they test the
      interplay between the frontend, backend services, databases, and any other
      external integrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their primary purpose is to answer the question: "Does the application, as
      a whole, meet the high-level business requirements and deliver the
      intended user experience?" If a user is supposed to be able to log in, add
      an item to their cart, and complete a purchase, you'd use an E2E test to
      automate this entire workflow to confirm its success.
    </p>
    <h3 id="whyE2ETestingIsImportant">
      Why E2E Testing is Important (But Not a Substitute for Unit Tests):
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Confidence in Releases:</strong> Successful E2E test suites provide
        a high degree of confidence that the main user flows are working correctly
        before deploying new versions of the application. They act as a final safety
        net, catching integration issues that unit or integration tests (which test
        interactions between smaller groups of components) might miss.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing User Experience:</strong> E2E tests are the closest automated
        approximation to how a real user experiences the application. They can catch
        issues related to UI rendering, navigation, and overall workflow usability
        that are outside the scope of unit tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verifying Critical Paths:</strong> They're particularly valuable
        for ensuring that the most critical paths and core functionalities of the
        application (e.g., user registration, checkout process, core data submission)
        are always operational.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="theHighLevelView">
      The High-Level View and the Overlooking of Unit Tests
    </h3>
    <p>
      The fact that E2E tests focus on these high-level requirements and
      observable user behavior might, in part, explain why the more granular and
      arguably more critical practice of unit testing is sometimes overlooked or
      undervalued. Stakeholders and even some developers might see a passing E2E
      test suite as sufficient proof that "everything works." This perspective
      is tempting because E2E tests often map directly to visible features and
      user stories.
    </p>
    <p>However, this overlooks the fundamental difference in purpose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>E2E tests</strong> verify that the assembled system meets external
        requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unit tests</strong> verify that individual components are internally
        correct, robust, and reusable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Systems can have passing E2E tests for their main flows while still being
      composed of poorly designed, brittle, and non-reusable units. These
      underlying weaknesses might not surface until a minor change breaks an
      obscure part of a unit, or until an attempt is made to reuse a component
      in a new context, leading to unexpected bugs that are hard to trace
      because the E2E tests for the original flow might still pass.
    </p>
    <h3 id="theComplementaryNature">
      The Complementary Nature of Testing Layers

    <p>
      A robust testing strategy employs multiple layers, each with its own

    <ol>

      <li>
        <strong>Integration Tests:</strong> These verify the interaction between
        groups of components or services.

    </ol>
    <p>
      E2E tests are an essential final check, ensuring all the well-unit-tested
      and integrated parts come together to deliver the expected high-level
      functionality. They confirm that the user can successfully navigate and
      use the application to achieve their goals. But their strength in
      verifying the "big picture" should never be mistaken as a reason to

      stylistic opinions. While ESLint can be configured to manage code style
      via Prettier and other plugins, its true power and core value lie
      significantly deeper: ESLint is a powerful static analysis tool designed
      to identify problematic patterns, potential bugs, and deviations from best

      If your only interaction with ESLint has been to fix complaints about

      nitpicky style enforcer. In fact, ESLint's core includes no stylistic

      The Reality: ESLint as a Powerful Bug Detector and Best Practice Enforcer
    </h3>
    <p>
      The real strength of ESLint emerges when it's augmented with specialized
      plugins that target specific areas of concern. Here are some of the most
      valuable ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>@eslint/js</code>
        <strong>:</strong> This foundational set catches a wide array of common JavaScript
        errors and logical mistakes, such as using variables before they are defined,
        unreachable code, or duplicate keys in object literals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin</code><strong>:</strong> Absolutely
        essential for TypeScript projects. This plugin allows ESLint to understand
        TypeScript syntax and apply rules that leverage TypeScript's type information.
        It can go far beyond what the TypeScript compiler (<code>tsc</code>)
        alone might enforce. They can flag potential runtime errors, misuse of
        promises (<code>no-floating-promises</code>,
        <code>no-misused-promises</code>), improper handling of <code>any</code>
        types, and enforce best practices for writing clear and safe TypeScript code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>eslint-plugin-sonarjs</code><strong>:</strong> This plugin is laser-focused
        on detecting bugs and "code smells" – patterns that indicate deeper potential
        issues. Rules like
        <code>sonarjs/no-all-duplicated-branches</code> (which finds if/else chains
        where all branches are identical), <code
          >sonarjs/no-identical-expressions</code
        > (detects redundant comparisons), or <code
          >sonarjs/no-element-overwrite</code
        >
        (prevents accidentally overwriting array elements) help catch subtle logical
        flaws that might otherwise slip into production.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>eslint-plugin-unicorn</code><strong>:</strong> While some of its rules
        are indeed stylistic or highly opinionated, many others in the recommended
        set promote writing more modern, readable, and robust JavaScript. For example,
        rules like <code>unicorn/no-unsafe-regex</code> help prevent regular expressions
        that could lead to ReDoS attacks, <code>unicorn/throw-new-error</code> enforces
        using new with Error objects, and <code
          >unicorn/prefer-modern-dom-apis</code

    <h2 id="letsTalkAboutReact">Let's Talk About React</h2>
    <p>
      In the ever-evolving landscape of frontend development, React has emerged
      as a dominant force, powering countless websites and applications across
      the web. While numerous frameworks and libraries compete for developers'
      attention, React consistently stands out for its balance of power,
      simplicity, and ecosystem support. This section explores why React has
      become a preferred choice for building user interfaces and why it
      continues to thrive in an industry known for rapid change and shifting
      preferences.
    </p>

    <h3 id="whyReactDominates">Why React Dominates the Frontend Landscape</h3>
    <p>
      React's dominance isn't accidental. It stems from a combination of
      thoughtful design decisions and community momentum that have created a
      virtuous cycle of adoption, contribution, and improvement. At its core,
      React introduced a paradigm shift in how we think about building user
      interfaces—moving from imperative DOM manipulation to declarative
      component-based architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The component model, where UI elements are broken down into reusable,
      self-contained pieces, aligns perfectly with modern software engineering
      principles. This approach encourages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reusability:</strong> Components can be shared across different parts
        of an application or even across projects, reducing duplication and ensuring
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Isolated components are easier to understand,
        test, and modify without affecting other parts of the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Teams can work on different components simultaneously
        with minimal conflicts, accelerating development.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="lowBarrierToEntry">
      Low Barrier to Entry: React's Approachable Learning Curve
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of React's most significant advantages is its relatively gentle
      learning curve, especially for developers already familiar with
      JavaScript. Unlike some frameworks that require learning entirely new
      templating languages or complex architectural patterns, React builds upon
      existing JavaScript knowledge, extending it rather than replacing it.
    </p>
    <p>Several factors contribute to React's accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Minimal API Surface:</strong> React's core API is surprisingly small.
        The fundamental concepts of components and props can be grasped quickly,
        allowing developers to start building meaningful applications early in their
        learning journey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JSX as an Intuitive Extension:</strong> While JSX might look strange
        at first glance, it quickly becomes intuitive for most developers. It combines
        the familiarity of HTML-like syntax with the full power of JavaScript, creating
        a natural way to describe UI components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Incremental Adoption:</strong> React doesn't demand a complete application
        rewrite. It can be integrated gradually into existing projects, allowing
        teams to learn and adopt at their own pace.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exceptional Documentation:</strong> React's official documentation
        is comprehensive, well-structured, and includes numerous examples and interactive
        tutorials. The React team has invested heavily in educational resources,
        making self-learning accessible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This low barrier to entry has significant practical implications. Teams
      can onboard new developers more quickly, reducing training costs and
      accelerating project timelines. The pool of available React developers is
      larger, making hiring easier. And the community's size ensures that almost
      any question or problem has already been addressed somewhere, with
      solutions readily available through a quick search.
    </p>

    <h3 id="wideUIEcosystem">
      The Wide UI Ecosystem: Building Blocks for Every Need
    </h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps one of React's most compelling advantages is its vast ecosystem of
      UI libraries and components. This rich landscape allows developers to
      leverage pre-built, well-tested components rather than building everything
      from scratch. This ecosystem is particularly valuable for accelerating
      development while maintaining high-quality standards.
    </p>
    <p>Some notable players in this ecosystem include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Headless UI Libraries:</strong> Libraries like <a

          target="_blank">TanStack Table</a
        >
        provide sophisticated implementations of specific UI patterns, handling edge
        cases and accessibility concerns that would be time-consuming to address
        from scratch.
      </li>
      <li>

          >React Spring</a
        > make complex animations approachable, with declarative APIs that integrate
        seamlessly with React's component model.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This ecosystem doesn't just save development time; it also promotes best
      practices. Many of these libraries prioritize accessibility and
      cross-browser compatibility, ensuring that applications built with them
      meet modern web standards without requiring developers to be experts in
      every area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modular nature of the React ecosystem also means developers can mix
      and match libraries based on project requirements, rather than being
      locked into a single framework's opinions. This flexibility allows for
      tailored solutions that address specific needs without unnecessary bloat.

    <h3 id="performanceLimitations">
      Performance Limitations: React's Struggle with Signals
    </h3>
    <p>
      Despite React's many strengths, it's important to acknowledge an area
      where it has fallen behind other modern frameworks: performance
      optimization through fine-grained reactivity. While React revolutionized
      UI development with its component model and virtual DOM, this same
      architecture now presents inherent limitations in an era where
      signal-based reactivity has become the gold standard for performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      React's rendering model follows a <a
        href="https://youtu.be/8pDqJVdNa44?si=g9fSPcHB0Y4J4OoE&t=542"
        target="_blank">"blow away the entire UI and rerender all of it"</a
      > approach. When state changes, React rebuilds the virtual DOM, compares it
      with the previous version, and then updates only the necessary parts of the
      actual DOM. While this was groundbreaking when introduced, it's now increasingly
      inefficient compared to the signal-based approaches adopted by frameworks like
      SolidJS, Svelte, Angular, Vue, Preact, and Qwik.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fundamental issue lies in React's architecture being incompatible with
      signals—a reactive programming pattern that enables truly fine-grained
      updates. With signal-based frameworks, dependencies are tracked at the
      level of individual variables or properties, allowing the framework to
      update only the specific DOM elements affected by a change, without the
      overhead of diffing entire component trees.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Memoization Tax:</strong> React developers must constantly employ
        <code>useMemo</code>,
        <code>useCallback</code>, and <code>React.memo</code> to prevent unnecessary
        rerenders. This "memoization tax" adds complexity to codebases and places
        the burden of performance optimization on developers rather than the framework
        itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complex State Management Workarounds:</strong> The limitations of
        React's built-in state management have spawned an entire ecosystem of libraries
        (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, etc.) that essentially work around React's
        core update model. These libraries either attempt to make the Context API
        more performant or use external state with <code
          >useSyncExternalStore</code
        > to control React's awareness of state changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fighting the Framework:</strong> Many performance optimizations in
        React feel like fighting against its natural behavior. Developers spend an
        inordinate amount of time trying to prevent React from rerendering, when
        not rerendering everything on every change should ideally be the default
        behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Even libraries that attempt to bring signal-like patterns to React, such
      as Signalis or Legend State, ultimately hit a performance ceiling because
      they must still work within React's reconciliation process. No matter how
      optimized the state management, all updates must eventually flow through
      React's diffing algorithm. My own experiments with <a
        href="https://github.com/eglove/ethang-monorepo/tree/master/packages/store"
        target="_blank">custom state management utilities</a
      >, show that performance improvements are modest at best, still falling
      within the same performance category as libraries like Zustand.
    </p>

    <p>
      This performance gap is particularly noticeable in data-heavy applications
      with frequent updates, where signal-based frameworks can be significantly
      more efficient. Benchmarks, such as the <a
        href="https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark"
        target="_blank">JS Framework Benchmark</a
      >, consistently show React lagging behind its signal-based competitors in
      update performance, sometimes by substantial margins. The benchmark
      results clearly demonstrate how frameworks like SolidJS, Svelte, Angular,
      Vue, Preact, and Qwik outperform React in various performance metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interestingly, the React team seems aware of these limitations. Their
      focus on server components and server-side rendering suggests a preference
      for moving state management to the server rather than addressing the
      fundamental client-side performance issues. This aligns with how Facebook
      itself uses React—not as a pure SPA framework but as part of a more
      server-oriented architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      For developers committed to the React ecosystem, this means accepting
      these performance trade-offs and either embracing the necessary
      optimization patterns or considering alternative frameworks for
      performance-critical applications. It also means recognizing that while
      React excels in many areas, its architecture makes it inherently less
      suited for highly dynamic, state-heavy client-side applications compared
      to more modern, signal-based alternatives.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stateManagementUnnecessary">
      State Management Libraries: An Unnecessary Abstraction
    </h3>
    <p>
      Despite React's performance limitations, there's a common misconception
      that complex state management libraries are necessary to build robust
      React applications. Many developers, especially those new to React,
      quickly adopt libraries like Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil without
      first exploring simpler alternatives. While these libraries served an
      important purpose during React's evolution, they've now become an
      unnecessary layer of complexity for most applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core issue isn't state management itself—it's the transformation of
      declarative code to imperative JavaScript and HTML. React's component
      model inherently mixes data with UI, leading to the "rerendering" problem
      we discussed earlier. This has spawned an entire ecosystem of libraries
      attempting to work around React's update model, but these solutions often
      introduce their own complexities without addressing the fundamental
      architectural limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of reaching for a third-party state management library, consider a
      simpler approach: using React's built-in <code>useSyncExternalStore</code>
      hook with your own custom state implementation. This approach gives you several
      advantages:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Control Over Reactivity:</strong> While we'll never have fine-grained
        reactivity in React (as discussed in the previous section), external state
        at least gives us the power to decide when and when not to notify React components
        of state changes. This control is crucial for optimizing performance in data-heavy
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplified Mental Model:</strong> By implementing a simple subscription
        interface rather than learning the specific patterns and jargon of a state
        management library, you reduce cognitive overhead and make your code more
        accessible to other developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tailored Solutions:</strong> You can implement state management that
        perfectly fits your application's needs, rather than conforming to the opinions
        and constraints of a third-party library.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A minimal implementation might look something like this:</p>

    <CodeBlock
      code={`
class StateManager<T> {
    private state: T;
    private subscribers: Set<() => void> = new Set();

    constructor(initialState: T) {
        this.state = initialState;
    }

    getState(): T {
        return this.state;
    }

    subscribe(callback: () => void) {
        this.subscribers.add(callback);
        return () => this.subscribers.delete(callback);
    }

    update(newState: T) {
        // Optional: Add validation or transformation logic here
        if (this.shouldNotify(newState)) {
            this.state = newState;
            this.notifySubscribers();
        }
    }

    private shouldNotify(newState: T): boolean {
        // Custom logic to determine if subscribers should be notified
        // For example, deep comparison, specific condition checks
        return true;
    }

    private notifySubscribers() {
        this.subscribers.forEach(subscriber => subscriber());
    }
}`}
    />

    <p>
      This simple class implements the subscription interface needed to work
      with <code>useSyncExternalStore</code>. In your React components, you can
      then use it like this:
    </p>

    <CodeBlock
      code={`
import { useSyncExternalStore } from "react";

// Component using the external store
function UserProfile() {
    const state = useSyncExternalStore(
        listener => userProfileStore.subscribe(listener),
        () => userProfileStore.getState(),
        () => userProfileStore.getState() // Optional server-side version
    );

    return <div>{state.name}</div>;
}`}
    />

    <p>
      The beauty of this approach is its simplicity and flexibility. You have
      complete control over when to notify subscribers, how to handle updates,
      and what optimizations to apply. For example, you might implement deep
      equality checks to prevent unnecessary updates, or add specific methods
      for common operations on your state.
    </p>

    <p>
      For async operations, TanStack Query is still recommended, as it excels at
      handling data fetching, caching, and synchronization with server state. It
      complements this approach perfectly, focusing on what it does best while
      leaving local state management to your custom implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern gives you the best of both worlds: the simplicity and control
      of a custom solution, with the power to optimize performance by
      controlling exactly when React components rerender. While we can't
      overcome React's fundamental limitations around fine-grained reactivity,
      this approach at least puts you in control of the rerendering process,
      rather than fighting against the framework or adding unnecessary
      abstractions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="reactFutureProof">React as a Future-Proof Investment</h3>
    <p>
      Investing time in learning and building with React has proven to be a
      sound long-term decision for many developers and organizations. Several
      factors contribute to React's staying power:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Backed by Meta:</strong> While being open-source, React benefits
        from significant investment and use by Meta (formerly Facebook), which ensures
        continued development and stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thoughtful Evolution:</strong> The React team has demonstrated a
        commitment to backward compatibility while still innovating. Major changes,
        like the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, are implemented with gradual
        migration paths rather than forcing breaking changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-Platform Potential:</strong> React's component model has extended
        beyond the web with React Native, allowing developers to leverage their React
        knowledge for mobile app development. This cross-platform capability increases
        the value of React expertise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Industry Adoption:</strong> React's widespread use across industries
        and company sizes means that React skills remain in high demand, making it
        a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The React team's focus on developer experience, evidenced by ongoing work
      on features like Server Components, Suspense, and concurrent rendering,
      suggests that React will continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of
      web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, React's influence extends beyond its own ecosystem. Many of
      its core ideas—component-based architecture—have influenced other
      frameworks and libraries, becoming standard patterns in modern frontend
      development. This means that even if another technology eventually
      supersedes React, the fundamental concepts will likely remain relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, React's combination of a low barrier to entry, a rich
      ecosystem, and long-term stability make it an excellent choice for a wide
      range of web development projects. While no technology is perfect for
      every use case, React's balance of simplicity and power, coupled with its
      thriving community, positions it as a reliable foundation for building
      modern web applications.

    <h2 id="theLocalFirstStack">
      Local First: Building for Performance and Resilience
    </h2>
    <p>
      While React provides an excellent foundation for building user interfaces,
      the architecture we build around it can dramatically impact both
      performance and user experience. Recent projects have shown the benefits
      of a workflow centered around a "local-first" approach that delivers
      exceptional performance and reliability. Rather than relying on services
      like Firebase, Supabase, or even full-stack frameworks like Next.js, this
      approach prioritizes local data storage with background synchronization.
    </p>

    <h3 id="localFirstPerformanceBenefits">
      Performance Benefits: Instantly Accessible Structured Data

      <li>
        <strong>Provide Immediate Feedback:</strong> User actions can be reflected
        in the UI immediately, with synchronization happening asynchronously in the
        background.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Function Offline:</strong> Applications remain fully functional without
        an internet connection, with changes synchronized when connectivity is restored.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce Server Load:</strong> With data processing happening on the
        client, server resources are conserved and can be scaled more efficiently.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach creates a fundamentally different user experience—one where
      the application feels instantaneously responsive rather than being at the
      mercy of network conditions. For data-heavy applications, the difference
      can be transformative, turning what might be a sluggish, frustrating
      experience into one that feels native and fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you adopt a local-first approach, you're essentially putting your
      users' experience first. You're saying, "I want your app to feel
      lightning-fast and reliable, regardless of your internet connection." This
      philosophy can transform how your applications perform and how users
      perceive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of local-first is that it doesn't require exotic technologies
      or complex architectures. Modern browsers already provide powerful storage
      capabilities that you can leverage with relatively simple code. What
      matters most is the architectural decision to prioritize local operations
      and treat network communication as a secondary, background process.

      Synchronization Strategies: Background Syncing Done Right
    </h3>
    <p>
      When building local-first applications, data synchronization is often the
      most challenging piece of the puzzle. How do you ensure your users' data
      stays in sync across devices while maintaining those lightning-fast local
      interactions you've worked so hard to create?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's talk about some synchronization strategies that can help you achieve
      the perfect balance between performance and data consistency:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Optimistic Updates:</strong> Don't make your users wait! Apply changes
        to the local data immediately and sync with the server in the background.
        This creates a responsive experience where actions feel instantaneous, even
        if the actual server communication takes time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intelligent Queuing:</strong> When a user makes changes while offline,
        queue those operations and execute them in the correct order when connectivity
        returns. This approach ensures that even complex sequences of operations
        are properly synchronized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Conflicts are inevitable in distributed
        systems. Consider strategies like "last write wins," three-way merging, or
        operational transforms depending on your application's needs. The key is
        making conflict resolution transparent to users whenever possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Selective Synchronization:</strong> Not all data needs to be synced
        immediately or completely. Allow users to control what syncs when, or implement
        priority-based syncing where critical data transfers first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delta Synchronization:</strong> Instead of sending entire data objects,
        transmit only what has changed. This reduces bandwidth usage and makes synchronization
        faster, especially on slower connections.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The synchronization approach you choose should align with your users'
      expectations and your application's specific requirements. For
      collaborative tools, real-time synchronization might be essential. For
      personal productivity apps, background syncing with clear indicators of
      sync status might be more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that transparency is crucial—your users should always understand
      the sync status of their data. Simple indicators showing "synced,"
      "syncing," or "offline" can go a long way toward building trust in your
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      By thoughtfully implementing these synchronization strategies, you can
      create applications that feel responsive and reliable under any network
      conditions. Your users will appreciate the seamless experience, even if
      they don't fully understand the complex synchronization mechanisms working
      behind the scenes.

    <h2 id="whyYouShouldUseWindows">Why You Should Use Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Windows offers a more productive development environment than many
      developers realize, especially when compared to the limitations of Ubuntu
      and the frustrating experience of Mac. Let's explore what makes Windows a
      superior choice for your development workflow.
    </p>

    <h3 id="packageManagementAdvantages">
      Package Management Advantages: WinGet vs. apt
    </h3>
    <p>
      One significant limitation of Ubuntu is its apt repository, which is very
      limited and not easy to search. You'll find it's more efficient to just
      Google "install Chrome on Ubuntu" than to stay in the terminal and search
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with WinGet? You'll discover that a simple search reveals not just
      Chrome but a wealth of available applications. You'll notice the contrast
      is striking - WinGet offers you a comprehensive, easily searchable package
      ecosystem that makes Ubuntu's apt feel archaic by comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider JetBrains Toolbox as an example. In Ubuntu, it's not available in
      the standard repository. When visiting the JetBrains website, you'll only
      find a .tar.gz download that doesn't contain a standard .deb file. This
      requires finding a user-made script to help with installation, and even
      then, you'll need to manually install multiple dependencies. The process
      altogether looks like this:
    </p>

    <CodeBlock
      code={`
sudo apt install libfuse2 libxi6 libxrender1 libxtst6 mesa-utils libfontconfig libgtk-3-bin

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nagygergo/jetbrains-toolbox-install/master/jetbrains-toolbox.sh | bash`}
    />

    <p>
      With WinGet? You simply type <code>winget install JetBrains.Toolbox</code>
      - that's it. The package Id is easily discoverable with a quick search via
      CLI, and the entire installation process is handled automatically without the
      need for multiple commands or external scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Mac? It has no built-in package manager, and Homebrew is mediocre at
      best. You'll notice it's similar to Chocolatey - Homebrew only tracks
      what's installed through it, not your entire system.
    </p>

    <h3 id="productivityTools">Productivity Tools That Make a Difference</h3>
    <p>
      When you need to quickly find out where an installation is, or where
      anything is on your file system, you should try Everything Search. It's a
      lightning-fast file indexing and search utility that dramatically
      outperforms the native search capabilities of any other operating system
      you might have used.
    </p>

    <video controls src="/videos/everything-search.mp4"></video>

    <p>With Everything Search, you get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Instantaneous file and directory location across your entire system
      </li>
      <li>Advanced filtering options for precise searches you need</li>
      <li>
        An ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality in ways you'll
        find useful
      </li>
      <li>
        Integration with other Windows tools like PowerToys that you'll use
        daily
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Linux alternatives like FSearch and Catfish exist, but they don't match
      the speed and integration capabilities of Everything Search. Mac users
      face an even bigger challenge, as the platform lacks any comparable
      alternative.
    </p>

    <p>
      PowerToys stands out as one of the most impressive projects for Windows.
      It's a set of utilities for power users that becomes indispensable once
      you start using them. The project is constantly updated with new features
      nearly every week, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>FancyZones:</strong> A window manager that allows you to create complex,
        customized layouts far beyond what macOS or Linux offer natively
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PowerToys Run/Command Palette:</strong> Quick launchers that integrate
        with Everything Search for unparalleled system navigation
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Text Extractor:</strong> OCR capabilities built right into your OS
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keyboard Manager:</strong> Complete keyboard remapping without limitations
        - you'll laugh at Mac's keyboard settings which only allow you to swap two
        keys
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environment Variables and Hosts File Editors:</strong> GUI interfaces
        for common development configuration tasks you'll find incredibly useful
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>File Explorer Add-ons:</strong> Preview handlers for development-related
        file formats you work with
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced Paste, Awake, Color Picker, Screen Ruler</strong> and many
        more utilities that will make your workflow smoother
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For Ubuntu, you're not likely to find alternatives for most of these
      tools, and when available, the quality is typically inferior. As for Mac?
      You'll need to pay for dozens of equivalents, and the money you spend will
      likely go towards lower quality applications.
    </p>

    <h3 id="screenshotAndVideoTools">
      Screenshot and Video Tools That Just Work
    </h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to video recording and screenshots, you'll find that Windows
      excels with built-in tools that are both powerful and easy to use. You'll
      love how the Windows Snipping Tool lets you hit a shortcut, select a
      window, and instantly get a video or screenshot - no complex setup
      required like you might experience on other platforms.
    </p>

    <LocalImage alt="windows snipping tool" src={snippingTool} />

    <p>
      For more advanced screenshot needs, try Greenshot which offers powerful
      editing and sharing capabilities that make capturing and annotating your
      screen effortless.
    </p>

    <LocalImage alt="greenshot" src={greenshot} />

    <p>
      Ubuntu equivalents like Flameshot exist but aren't as polished or
      feature-complete. Mac users face similar challenges, often having to pay
      for screenshot utilities or settle for inferior built-in options.
    </p>

    <h3 id="powerShellAdvantages">
      PowerShell: A Superior Command-Line Experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      You'll find PowerShell offers a more readable and expressive alternative
      to Bash's cryptic syntax. The key advantages you'll appreciate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Object-Based Pipeline:</strong> It works with objects instead of
        text, enabling you to do precise data manipulation
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistent Syntax:</strong> The intuitive verb-noun commands (Get-Process,
        Set-Location) improve your discoverability
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modern Features:</strong> You can rely on its exception handling,
        advanced data structures, and optional strong typing
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Built-in JSON/XML Handling:</strong> You don't need additional parsing
        tools like you do with other shells
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You might appreciate that PowerShell is open-source and cross-platform,
      though you'll notice it runs slightly slower on Linux and Mac.
    </p>

    <h3 id="guiCustomization">
      GUI Customization: Practical vs. Time-Consuming
    </h3>
    <p>
      While Linux is known for customization, you'll find many tutorials and
      themes are now outdated or unsupported. You might prefer how Windows
      offers a comfortable, modern default experience without the cluttered
      taskbar of Mac or the dated aesthetics of Ubuntu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows strikes the right balance for you - it's customizable when you
      need it to be but doesn't require weeks of tweaking to achieve a
      productive environment like you might experience with Linux.
    </p>

    <h3 id="customizationAndControl">
      Removing the Branding and Taking Control
    </h3>
    <p>
      You've probably noticed that both Windows and Mac push their ecosystems
      and productivity apps, while Ubuntu relies primarily on open source with
      optional Pro security updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll appreciate how Windows offers more control through WinGet, which
      provides you access to uninstall system components that other package
      managers can't touch. While it's not a one-click solution, you'll find
      Windows settings allow you to disable intrusive features for a cleaner
      experience that you'll prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have you noticed how Mac users often accept the ecosystem lock-in and paid
      apps despite free alternatives being available elsewhere? This behavior
      seems puzzling when considering the value proposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, Windows deserves more credit than it typically receives.
      While Ubuntu makes for a good work environment but lacks productivity
      features you need, and Mac's aesthetics and usability can be frustrating,
      Windows offers a balanced approach. You'll learn that sometimes
      "simplicity" doesn't mean "clean" - it can mean fewer features to make
      your life easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows has evolved into a powerful development platform that combines
      mainstream stability with the tools and customization you need as a
      developer. Its package management, productivity tools, modern
      command-line, and balanced customization make it excellent if you value
      both productivity and polish.
