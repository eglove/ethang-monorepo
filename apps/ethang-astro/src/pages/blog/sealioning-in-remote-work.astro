  <h1>Navigating Sealioning in Remote Work Environments</h1>
  <WordCount image={{src: sealioningImage, alt: "sealioning comic"}} />
  <p>
    If you've spent any time in remote work environments—especially on platforms
    like Slack, Teams, or Discord—you've likely encountered a peculiar form of
    communication that leaves you feeling drained, frustrated, and questioning
    your own expertise. You might not have known it had a name, but this
    phenomenon is called "sealioning," and it's become increasingly prevalent in
    our digital workspaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a software engineer who has navigated remote work for years, I've
    witnessed sealioning derail productive conversations, waste valuable time,
    and create unnecessary tension among team members. In this post, I'll break
    down what sealioning is, how it manifests in remote work environments, and
    most importantly, how to handle it effectively while maintaining your
    productivity and sanity.
  </p>

  <h2 id="whatIsSealioning">What Is Sealioning?</h2>

  <LocalImage

    src={sealioning2Image}
    alt="sealion asking trainer about political opinions"
  />

  <p>
    Sealioning is a type of trolling or harassment that consists of pursuing
    people with relentless requests for evidence, often tangential or previously
    addressed, while maintaining a pretense of civility and sincerity. The
    sealioner feigns ignorance and politeness while making persistent demands
    for answers and explanations, typically ignoring or sidestepping any
    evidence already presented.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes sealioning particularly insidious is that it disguises itself as
    a sincere attempt to learn and communicate. The questions may seem innocent
    on the surface, but they're intended to exhaust the target's patience,
    attention, and communicative effort, and to portray the target as
    unreasonable when they eventually get frustrated.
  </p>

  <h3 id="originOfTheTerm">Origin of the Term</h3>
  <p>
    The term "sealioning" originated from a 2014 comic strip called "The
    Terrible Sea Lion" by David Malki in his webcomic Wondermark. In the comic,
    a character expresses a dislike of sea lions, only for a sea lion to appear
    and persistently ask her to justify her statement, following her around and
    even into her bedroom, all while maintaining an exaggerated civility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The comic resonated with many people who had experienced similar
    interactions online, particularly on platforms like Twitter. The term
    quickly became popular as a way to describe this specific type of trolling
    behavior that hides behind a veneer of politeness and "just asking
    questions."
  </p>

  <h3 id="keyCharacteristics">Key Characteristics</h3>
  <p>Sealioning typically involves several key characteristics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Persistent questioning</strong> - Often about basic information or
      points that have already been addressed
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Feigned ignorance</strong> - Pretending not to understand explanations
      that have already been provided
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Insistence on civility</strong> - Maintaining a polite tone while being
      intrusive and demanding
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Moving goalposts</strong> - When one question is answered, immediately
      asking another without acknowledging the answer
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bad faith engagement</strong> - Not genuinely interested in learning,
      but in exhausting and frustrating the target
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Weaponized time and attention</strong> - Demanding disproportionate
      amounts of someone's time and energy
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In essence, sealioning is a form of "denial of service" attack targeted at
    humans rather than servers—it aims to overwhelm a person's capacity to
    respond by flooding them with seemingly innocent questions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sealioningInRemoteWork">Sealioning in Remote Work Environments</h2>
  <p>
    Remote work environments, with their heavy reliance on text-based
    communication, create perfect conditions for sealioning to flourish. Without
    the benefit of facial expressions, tone of voice, and other non-verbal cues,
    it can be harder to distinguish between genuine questions and sealioning
    tactics.
  </p>
  <p>
    In software development and other technical fields, where explaining complex
    concepts is already challenging, sealioning can be particularly disruptive.
    Let's look at some common examples of how this manifests in remote work
    settings.
  </p>

  <h3 id="slackAndTeamsExamples">Slack and Teams Examples</h3>
  <p>
    In chat platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams, sealioning often looks
    like this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Architecture Interrogation</strong>: A developer shares a
      proposed architecture for a new feature. Instead of offering constructive
      feedback, a sealioner bombards them with dozens of questions about edge
      cases that are either irrelevant at this stage or already addressed in the
      documentation. Each answer is met with "But what about..." without
      acknowledging the previous response.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Documentation Demand</strong>: After a team member shares
      information in a channel, a sealioner repeatedly asks for "sources" or
      "documentation" for basic industry practices or company-specific processes
      that are common knowledge among the team. When pointed to existing
      resources, they claim those aren't sufficient without specifying why.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Thread Hijacker</strong>: A technical discussion is underway
      when someone jumps in with tangential questions that derail the
      conversation. When asked to start a separate thread, they insist their
      questions are directly relevant and must be answered before the original
      discussion can continue.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="codeReviewSealioning">Code Review Sealioning</h3>
  <p>Code reviews are particularly vulnerable to sealioning tactics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Endless Nitpicker</strong>: Instead of focusing on substantive
      issues, a reviewer leaves dozens of comments about minor stylistic
      preferences that aren't part of the team's agreed-upon standards. When the
      author addresses these, the reviewer finds new, equally minor issues to
      raise.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The "Just Curious" Blocker</strong>: A reviewer blocks a pull
      request with questions like "I'm just curious why you chose this
      approach?" When the author explains their reasoning, the response is "But
      wouldn't it be better if..." without acknowledging the constraints or
      trade-offs the author has already explained.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Historical Interrogator</strong>: "Why was this done this way
      originally?" "Who decided on this pattern?" "Can you explain the entire
      history of this module before I approve your two-line change?" These
      questions shift the burden to the current developer to justify decisions
      they may not have been involved in.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="meetingSealioning">Meeting Sealioning</h3>
  <p>Even in video meetings, sealioning can occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Time Thief</strong>: Someone asks a series of "quick
      questions" that eat up the entire meeting time, preventing the agenda from
      being addressed. When time runs out, they suggest scheduling another
      meeting to continue the discussion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Circular Questioner</strong>: After a decision has been made
      and the team is ready to move on, someone circles back to a point that was
      already thoroughly discussed, claiming they "just want to make sure we've
      considered everything."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Selective Listener</strong>: A team member repeatedly asks
      questions that were already answered earlier in the meeting, forcing
      others to repeat themselves and creating the impression that the original
      explanation was inadequate.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="betterCommunicationAlternatives">
    Better Communication Alternatives
  </h2>
  <p>
    Understanding sealioning helps us recognize it, but it's equally important
    to understand what healthy, productive communication looks like in remote
    work environments. Here are some alternatives to sealioning behaviors:
  </p>

  <h3 id="askingGenuineQuestions">Asking Genuine Questions</h3>
  <p>Genuine questions differ from sealioning in several important ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>They're specific and focused</strong>, not vague or open-ended
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They acknowledge previous answers</strong> and build upon them
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They're asked with appropriate timing</strong>, not interrupting
      or derailing discussions
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They respect the other person's time and expertise</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They're asked with a genuine desire to understand</strong>, not to
      challenge or exhaust
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, instead of asking "Why would you use React for this? Can you
    justify that choice?" (which puts the other person on the defensive), you
    might ask "I'm curious about the decision to use React here. Were there
    specific features that made it a good fit for this project?"
  </p>

  <h3 id="respectingExpertise">Respecting Expertise</h3>
  <p>
    In technical fields, respecting others' expertise is crucial for productive
    collaboration:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Acknowledge domain knowledge</strong>: Recognize when someone has
      deeper expertise in a particular area
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do your homework</strong>: Before asking basic questions, check
      documentation and search for existing answers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be transparent about your knowledge level</strong>: It's fine to
      say "I'm new to this area" rather than pretending to know more than you do
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accept that you don't need to understand everything</strong>:
      Sometimes it's appropriate to trust others' expertise without demanding
      they explain every detail
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="productiveDisagreement">Productive Disagreement</h3>
  <p>
    Disagreement is healthy and necessary in technical work, but there's a world
    of difference between productive disagreement and sealioning:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Be specific about your concerns</strong>: "I'm concerned about the
      performance implications of this approach" is more helpful than "Are you
      sure this is the best way?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Offer alternatives</strong>: Don't just question—suggest other
      approaches
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Focus on the work, not the person</strong>: "This implementation
      might have scaling issues" rather than "Why would you implement it this
      way?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Know when to let go</strong>: Once you've made your case and a
      decision has been made, move forward constructively
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use appropriate channels</strong>: Some disagreements are better
      handled in private messages or dedicated meetings, not public channels
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="handlingSealions">Handling Sealions While Remaining Productive</h2>
  <LocalImage
    loading="lazy"
    src={sealioning3Image}
    alt="sealion running after someone"
  />
  <p>
    Despite our best efforts to create healthy communication environments,
    you'll likely encounter sealioning in your remote work. Here are strategies
    for handling it effectively while maintaining your productivity and
    professionalism:
  </p>

  <h3 id="recognizingPatterns">Recognizing the Patterns</h3>
  <p>
    The first step in handling sealioning is recognizing it. Watch for these
    patterns:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Questions that seem disproportionate to the topic at hand</li>
    <li>The same questions being asked repeatedly in different ways</li>
    <li>
      Questions that ignore or dismiss the answers you've already provided
    </li>
    <li>A sense that you're being "tested" rather than engaged with</li>
    <li>Conversations that leave you feeling drained and frustrated</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Trust your instincts. If an interaction feels like it's in bad faith, it
    probably is.
  </p>

  <h3 id="settingBoundaries">Setting Clear Boundaries</h3>
  <p>Once you recognize sealioning, setting boundaries is essential:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Limit your engagement</strong>: It's okay to say "I've answered
      this question already" or "This isn't a productive use of our time right
      now"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Redirect to appropriate resources</strong>: "Take a look at our
      test suite for this component - it demonstrates exactly how the feature
      works in different scenarios. The tests serve as living documentation of
      the intended behavior."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set time limits</strong>: "I can spend 15 minutes discussing this
      now, but then I need to get back to my other tasks."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Involve others when necessary</strong>: If sealioning is
      persistent, it may be appropriate to involve a manager or team lead
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="explainingToSealioner">
    Explaining to a Sealioner Why Their Behavior is Problematic
  </h4>
  <p>
    One of the challenges with sealioning is that the person doing it may not
    realize the impact of their behavior. Here's how you might explain to
    someone that their questioning pattern is a form of harassment, whether
    intentional or not:
  </p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-primary">
      I've noticed a pattern in our interactions where you ask multiple
      follow-up questions without acknowledging my answers. This creates a
      burden where I'm constantly explaining and re-explaining, which is
      exhausting and prevents me from doing my actual work.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-primary">
      When you ask questions without sharing your own thoughts or context, it
      puts the entire burden of the conversation on me. This is a pattern known
      as "sealioning" and it can be a form of unintentional harassment.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-end">
    <div class="chat-header">Colleague</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble">
      I'm just asking questions to understand. How is that harassment?
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-primary">
      I appreciate your desire to understand. The issue isn't asking questions -
      it's the pattern and approach. When you ask multiple questions without
      sharing your own thinking, it creates an imbalanced conversation where one
      person does all the work.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-primary">
      A more productive approach would be to share your current understanding
      and specific concerns, rather than asking open-ended questions. For
      example, instead of asking "Why did you choose this approach?" you could
      say "I'm wondering if this approach might have performance issues
      because..."
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-end">
    <div class="chat-bubble">
      I didn't realize how it was coming across. I'll try to be more specific
      and share my thinking.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h4 id="beyondBoundaries">
    Beyond Setting Boundaries: Strategies for Work Environments
  </h4>
  <p>
    Setting boundaries is important, but in professional settings, you may need
    additional strategies to handle sealioning effectively:
  </p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-secondary">2+2=4</div>
  </div>
  <div class="chat chat-end">
    <div class="chat-header">Sealioner</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble">What do you mean?</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong
      >Strategy 1: Redirect with a question about their understanding</strong
    >
  </p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-secondary">
      I'm referring to basic addition. What part are you unclear about
      specifically? Do you have a different understanding you'd like to share?
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong
      >Strategy 2: Provide a brief explanation once, then move to documentation</strong
    >
  </p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-secondary">
      It's a standard arithmetic equation. If you need more background, here's a
      link to our documentation on mathematical operations. Let's move on to the
      task at hand.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Strategy 3: Engage the broader team</strong></p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-secondary">
      @channel Does anyone else have questions about this arithmetic operation?
      I want to make sure we're all on the same page before moving forward.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong
      >Strategy 4: Use the "yes, and" technique to move the conversation forward</strong
    >
  </p>

  <div class="chat chat-start">
    <div class="chat-header">You</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble chat-bubble-secondary">
      Yes, 2+2=4, and based on that, we can calculate our project timeline as
      follows... [continues with the actual work]
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    These strategies help you maintain professionalism while preventing the
    conversation from being derailed. The key is to shift from a defensive
    position to one that maintains momentum on the actual work.
  </p>

  <h3 id="documentationAsShield">Documentation as a Shield</h3>
  <p>
    Good documentation, especially <a
      href="/blog/how-i-code#documentationIsForUsers"
      >test-driven documentation</a
    >, can be your best defense against sealioning:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Let tests drive your documentation</strong>: Test cases are the
      most reliable and up-to-date form of documentation because they
      demonstrate actual behavior, are verified with each build, and show how
      your system actually works, not how someone thinks it works
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use architecture decision records (ADRs)</strong>: For technical
      decisions, ADRs document not just what was decided, but why, providing
      context that can head off unnecessary questioning
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="teamCulture">Cultivating a Healthy Team Culture</h3>
  <p>
    Individual responses to sealioning are important, but addressing it at the
    team level is even more effective:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Establish communication norms</strong>: Work with your team to
      create explicit guidelines about how questions should be asked and
      answered
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Model good behavior</strong>: Demonstrate respectful questioning
      and engagement in your own communications
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Address patterns, not incidents</strong>: If someone consistently
      engages in sealioning, focus on the pattern rather than individual
      instances
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create safe spaces for learning</strong>: Designate specific
      channels or times for in-depth questions and learning discussions
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Recognize and reward constructive communication</strong>:
      Acknowledge team members who communicate effectively and supportively
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Remember that some sealioning may be unintentional—people who are anxious,
    new to a team, or from different cultural backgrounds might ask questions in
    ways that seem like sealioning but aren't intended that way. Approach these
    situations with empathy while still maintaining your boundaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Sealioning can be frustrating and disruptive in remote work environments,
    but recognizing it is the first step toward addressing it effectively. By
    understanding what sealioning is, how it manifests in remote work, and how
    to respond to it, you can protect your time and energy while maintaining
    productive professional relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that your expertise and time are valuable. You don't owe endless
    explanations to someone who isn't engaging in good faith. By setting clear
    boundaries, leveraging documentation, and working with your team to create
    healthy communication norms, you can minimize the impact of sealioning and
    focus on what matters: doing great work together, even when you're miles
    apart.
