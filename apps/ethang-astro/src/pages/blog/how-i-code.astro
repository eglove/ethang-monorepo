        <h2 id="javaScriptIsNotAProgrammingLanguage">JavaScript Is Not a Programming Language</h2>
        <p>When we talk about web development, JavaScript is undeniably at the core of nearly everything interactive we
            see
            online. It's the language that makes pages dynamic, handles user input, and powers complex web applications.
            But
            despite its pervasive influence and incredible capabilities, I want to challenge a common perception: is
            JavaScript truly a "programming language" in the same vein as C++, Java, or Python, or is it something else
            entirely—a highly effective scripting language that acts as an API to more robust, lower-level systems?</p>
        <h3 id="javascriptAsTheUltimateApi">JavaScript as the Ultimate API</h3>
        <p>Think about it: what does JavaScript do? In a browser environment, it manipulates the Document Object Model
            (DOM), fetches data, responds to events, and interacts with various Web APIs like <code>localStorage</code>,
            <code>fetch</code>, or <code>WebGL</code>. I see it as the conductor of an orchestra, but the instruments
            themselves—the browser's rendering engine, the network stack, the underlying operating system—are built
            using
            languages like C++, Rust, or assembly.</p>
        <p>From this perspective, I believe JavaScript functions less like a foundational programming language and more like a
            powerful scripting interface. It's the language we use to tell the browser (which is itself a complex
            application written in low-level languages) what to do. I see it as an API, a set of commands and conventions, that
            allows us to interact with the browser's core functionalities. In my view, robust programming languages typically
            provide
            their own comprehensive set of tools and direct control over system resources; JavaScript, by design,
            largely
            abstracts this away, operating within the confines of its host environment.</p>
        <h3 id="theMissingStandardLibrary">The Missing Standard Library: A Key Indicator</h3>
        <p>I think one of the strongest arguments for viewing JavaScript this way is its inherent lack of a comprehensive
            standard
            library. What do I mean by a "standard library"? It's a collection of pre-built functions, modules, and
            data
            structures that come bundled with a programming language, providing common functionalities like file system
            access, networking, advanced data manipulation, or date/time utilities. When I look at other languages, I see that Python has a vast standard library,
            Java
            has its rich API, and even C++ has a well-defined standard library.</p>
        <p>JavaScript? Not so much. When I'm working on a project, if I need robust date manipulation, I'm reaching for
            <code>luxon</code>. If I need utility functions for arrays or objects, I'm often considering
            <code>lodash</code>.
            For
            proper async management, I'm using <code>TanStack Query</code>. I cover these in, "<a
                    href="https://ethang.dev/blog/javascript-standard-library/" target="_blank">Why You Should Install
                That
                JS Library</a>," which acts as a testament to this reality. We <i>rely</i> on the vast ecosystem of NPM
            packages precisely because core JavaScript doesn't natively provide many of these essential functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>I find that this reliance on third-party packages, while incredibly powerful and flexible, highlights that JavaScript
            itself
            doesn't offer the self-contained, batteries-included environment we associate with traditional programming
            languages. In my experience, it needs to be <i>supplemented</i>.</p>
        <h3 id="theInevitableSupplementation">The Inevitable Supplementation</h3>
        <p>This brings me to the core of why I believe JavaScript, in its most effective forms, must always be supplemented by
            other
            "programming language" paradigms or tools:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Backend Logic and Templating:</strong> Historically and still frequently, complex application
                logic,
                database interactions, and server-side templating are handled by backend programming languages like
                Python
                (Django, Flask), Ruby (Rails), Java (Spring), or Node.js (which, while using JavaScript syntax, operates
                on
                a runtime environment like V8, which is written in C++). These languages are designed for robust data
                processing, security, and managing persistent state outside the client's browser. JavaScript on the
                frontend
                acts as the interface, displaying data and sending requests to these more robust backend systems.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The "Modern JS Ecosystem": A Programming Language Stack in Disguise:</strong> The rise of
                TypeScript
                and powerful bundlers like Vite, Webpack, and Parcel further reinforces this idea.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> This isn't just "JavaScript with types." It's a superset that
                        compiles
                        down to JavaScript, introducing static typing, interfaces, enums, and other features common in
                        strongly-typed programming languages. We use TypeScript to bring robustness, scalability, and
                        maintainability—qualities often lacking in pure, untyped JavaScript for large projects. It's
                        almost
                        like we're building a more robust "programming language" on top of JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Parcel):</strong> These tools transform, optimize, and combine
                        our
                        JavaScript, CSS, and other assets. They handle module resolution, transpilation (converting
                        modern
                        JavaScript to older versions for browser compatibility), code splitting, and more. While they
                        work
                        with JavaScript, they are complex applications themselves, often written in lower-level
                        languages or
                        leveraging Node.js APIs, and are essential for delivering performant and production-ready web
                        applications.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NPM Packages:</strong> As mentioned, the sheer volume and necessity of NPM packages for
                        common tasks underscore JavaScript's reliance on external modules to fill the gaps that a
                        comprehensive standard library would typically address. These packages collectively form a
                        de-facto,
                        community-driven "standard library," but it's not inherent to the language itself.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Beyond "Vanilla JS" for Production Apps:</strong>
                A common misconception is that modern production-grade web applications can be built with "pure vanilla
                JavaScript." This often stems from a perspective where a backend language handles all the "real
                programming"
                and HTML templating, with JavaScript playing a minimal, decorative role. However, for any production
                application aiming for a rich, interactive, and maintainable user experience, "pure vanilla JavaScript"
                is
                simply not a viable option.
                <br>
                You essentially have two primary paths to build a robust web application, and both involve significant
                supplementation:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Path A: Embrace the Modern JavaScript Ecosystem:</strong> This involves leveraging tools
                        like TypeScript for type safety and scalability, JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) for
                        component-based architecture and efficient UI updates, and the vast NPM ecosystem for libraries
                        that
                        fill the gaps of JavaScript's non-existent standard library. Bundlers like Vite or Webpack are
                        then
                        crucial for optimizing and packaging your client-side code for deployment. In this scenario,
                        JavaScript (or TypeScript) is doing a significant amount of the "programming" on the
                        client-side,
                        managing complex UI states, handling routing, and making asynchronous API calls.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Path B: Rely on a Backend Programming Language and its Ecosystem:</strong> In this
                        approach,
                        a backend language (e.g., Python with Django/Flask, Ruby with Rails, Java with Spring, PHP with
                        Laravel) takes on the primary role of generating HTML templates, managing server-side logic,
                        database interactions, and authentication. Client-side JavaScript's role might be limited to
                        small,
                        isolated interactive elements or form validations. Here, the "real programming" for the
                        application's core logic and structure is handled by the backend language and its comprehensive
                        frameworks and libraries, effectively serving in place of the modern JavaScript ecosystem for
                        much
                        of the application's functionality.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                There is <strong>never</strong> a case where a production-ready application can be built solely with
                "pure
                vanilla JavaScript" without any form of supplementation from either a robust backend programming
                language or
                the modern JavaScript ecosystem. The demands of performance, scalability, maintainability, and user
                experience in today's web necessitate the structure, tools, and libraries that these ecosystems provide.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="isJavaScriptNotAProgrammingLanguage">So, Is JavaScript "Not a Programming Language" Then?</h3>
        <p>My argument isn't that JavaScript is "bad" or "incapable." Far from it! I think it's incredibly powerful and has
            revolutionized the web. The distinction I'm drawing is one of fundamental design and role.</p>
        <p>I believe it's more accurate to view JavaScript as an extraordinarily versatile and high-level scripting
            language, purpose-built for interacting with and manipulating web environments. In my view, it excels as an API layer,
            allowing us to orchestrate complex user experiences. However, I've found that for the underlying heavy lifting, the
            foundational
            system interactions, and the robust structuring of large-scale applications, JavaScript frequently leans on
            or
            necessitates the support of environments and tools that are themselves built upon or emulate the
            characteristics
            of traditional programming languages.</p>
        <p>This perspective helps me appreciate JavaScript for what it is: an incredibly effective, adaptable, and
            indispensable scripting interface that, when combined with its powerful ecosystem, enables us to build the
            dynamic and interactive web we know and love. I see it as a language that thrives on collaboration—with browsers,
            with
            backend systems, and with its ever-expanding universe of tools and libraries. And in that, I find there's a unique
            beauty and strength.</p>
        <h2 id="typescriptIsAdditional">TypeScript Is An Additional Layer of Protection, Not a Replacement</h2>
        <p>TypeScript is a powerful tool, catching errors early and boosting productivity. When we combine it with
            runtime validation libraries like Zod, we often establish robust data contracts at our application
            boundaries. This can lead to a common assumption: once data passes these initial checks, it's "safe" and
            needs no further runtime scrutiny. In this section, I'll challenge that notion, exploring the crucial
            distinction between build-time and runtime type checks and emphasizing why comprehensive testing for runtime
            edge cases remains essential, even in a meticulously validated TypeScript codebase.</p>
        <h3 id="buildTimeVsRuntime">Build-Time vs. Runtime Type Checks: A Fundamental Difference</h3>
        <p>Build-time type checks are TypeScript's domain. They happen during compilation, before our code ever runs.
            I've seen how TypeScript analyzes our code, inferring types, and flags mismatches based on our annotations. If a function
            expects numbers but gets a string, TypeScript stops us cold, preventing compilation until we fix it. I find this
            static analysis incredibly powerful for early bug detection.</p>
        <p>However, I want to emphasize this critical point: TypeScript's types are erased when our code compiles to plain
            JavaScript. At runtime, our application executes dynamic JavaScript. In my experience, TypeScript ensures type safety during
            development, but it offers no inherent guarantees about the data our application will encounter live. I've observed that the
            compiled JavaScript simply runs based on the values present at that moment, stripped of any TypeScript type
            information.</p>
        <h3 id="theMisconceptionOnceValidated">The Misconception: "Once Validated, Always Safe"</h3>
        <p>I've noticed that many developers, especially those using TypeScript with runtime validation libraries like Zod, assume that
            data, once validated at entry points (e.g., API requests, form submissions), is perfectly typed and "safe"
            throughout its journey. In my experience, this often leads to the belief that internal functions, having received
            Zod-validated data, no longer need defensive checks.</p>
        <p>I understand this perspective, but I believe it overlooks a crucial reality: data can become "untyped" or
            unexpectedly malformed after initial validation. I've seen how internal transformations, coercions, or complex state
            changes can introduce issues. Even data that I've verified as perfectly valid at the boundary can cause runtime problems if our
            internal logic doesn't account for JavaScript's dynamic nature.</p>
        <h3 id="whyRuntimeEdgeCasesMatter">Why Runtime Edge Cases Matter (Even for "Safe" Data)</h3>
        <p>I've learned that JavaScript's dynamic nature means that even with TypeScript and initial validation, our code can encounter
            "garbage" data or unexpected states that static checks and initial runtime validators simply can't foresee
            in all internal contexts. In my experience, TypeScript operates on assumptions about our code's structure, and Zod validates a
            snapshot of data. I've found that neither guarantees data integrity throughout its entire lifecycle. Here's how I've seen data
            still lead to runtime issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>NaN</code> <strong>(Not-A-Number):</strong> A numeric field might pass Zod validation, but
                subsequent arithmetic (e.g., division by zero, internal string parsing) can introduce <code>NaN</code>.
                TypeScript still sees a <code>number</code>, but <code>NaN</code> propagates silently, leading to
                incorrect results or unpredictable behavior if unchecked.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: NaN propagation
let validNumber = 10;
let result = validNumber / 0; // result is Infinity

// If 'result' is then used in further calculations without checks
// and an unexpected non-numeric value is introduced
let anotherResult = result * "hello"; // anotherResult becomes NaN
console.log(anotherResult); // NaN`}/>

            <li><strong>Nullish Values (<code class="!font-normal">null</code>, <code
                    class="!font-normal">undefined</code>):</strong> TypeScript is excellent at identifying optional
                properties (e.g., <code>user.address?</code>). However, in complex systems, <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>
                can still appear unexpectedly where we might assume a value exists due to prior logic or
                transformations. This often happens as systems scale, and data flows through multiple layers, merges, or
                default assignments. A developer might overlook a potential <code>undefined</code> in a deeply nested or
                conditionally assigned property, leading to runtime errors.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Nullish value in a complex abstraction

// Imagine this function aggregates data from multiple sources
// and might return a partial UserProfile
function getUserProfileFromSources(userId: string): UserProfile {
  // In a real app, this would involve fetching from DB, API, etc.
  // For demonstration, let's simulate a case where contactInfo might be missing
  if (userId === 'user123') {
    return {
      id: 'user123',
      preferences: { theme: 'dark' } // contactInfo is missing
    };

  };
}

const currentUser = getUserProfileFromSources('user123');

// Later in the application, a component or service might assume contactInfo exists
// for all logged-in users, perhaps after a "default" assignment that wasn't always applied.
// TypeScript might warn, but in a large codebase, such warnings can be overlooked
// or implicitly bypassed by casting or non-null assertions (!).
try {
  // Developer might have assumed contactInfo is always present due to a previous step
  // that was supposed to ensure it, but failed for certain user types/data.
  console.log(currentUser.contactInfo.email); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'email')
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Runtime error accessing contact info:", e);
}`}/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Empty Values:</strong> An array or string might pass Zod validation as present and typed
                correctly, but subsequent filtering, mapping, or string manipulation can result in an empty array
                (<code>[]</code>) or empty string (<code>""</code>). Logic expecting content (e.g., iterating, parsing)
                might break or yield unintended results if these empty values aren't handled in internal functions.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Empty array causing unexpected behavior
function processItems(items: string[]) {
  // Zod might validate items as string[]
  // But if items becomes empty after filtering
  const filteredItems = items.filter(item => item.length > 5); // Could be []

  // This loop won't run, or subsequent logic might fail if it expects at least one item
  filteredItems.forEach(item => console.log(\`Processing $\{item\}\`));

  if (filteredItems.length === 0) {
    console.log("No items to process after filtering.");
  }

processItems(["short", "tiny"]); // "No items to process after filtering."`}/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unexpected Data Structures from Internal Transformations:</strong> Even with validated external
                data, internal transformations can produce unexpected structures if not meticulously coded. A complex
                aggregation or a function dynamically building objects might, under certain conditions, return an object
                missing a crucial property, or an array where a single object was expected.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Internal transformation leading to missing property
function transformData(data: { valueA: number; valueB: number; isSpecial: boolean }) {
  // Assume 'data' is initially validated by Zod
  let transformed: any = {};
  transformed.calculatedValue = data.valueA + data.valueB;

  if (data.isSpecial) {
    transformed.specialKey = "extra info";
  }
  // If later code expects 'specialKey' to always exist, it will fail when isSpecial is false
  return transformed;
}

const result = transformData({ valueA: 1, valueB: 2, isSpecial: false });
// If another function tries to use result.specialKey, it will be undefined
// and might cause errors if not checked.
console.log(result.specialKey); // undefined`}/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript's Automatic Coercions:</strong> Despite TypeScript, JavaScript's flexible type
                coercion rules can lead to surprising behavior within our application. If a <code>number</code> is
                implicitly concatenated with a <code>string</code> deep in our logic (<code>someNumber + ""</code>), it
                becomes a string. If a subsequent function expects a number, this hidden coercion can cause unexpected
                runtime outcomes not caught by static analysis.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Automatic coercion
function calculateTotal(price: number, quantity: number) {
  return price * quantity;
}

let itemPrice = 10;
let itemQuantity: any = "5"; // This might bypass TypeScript if it's from a dynamic source or internal string conversion

// If not explicitly converted, JavaScript might coerce in unexpected ways
let total = calculateTotal(itemPrice, itemQuantity); // 10 * "5" -> 50 (works here, but can be unpredictable)
console.log(total); // 50

itemQuantity = "five";
total = calculateTotal(itemPrice, itemQuantity); // 10 * "five" -> NaN
console.log(total); // NaN, which could then propagate`}/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Native Methods with Undocumented Throws:</strong> Many native JavaScript methods can throw
                errors under specific, sometimes poorly documented, conditions. For instance, certain string or array
                methods might throw if called on <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, even if prior code seemed
                to ensure a valid type. TypeScript doesn't predict or prevent these runtime exceptions, making testing
                crucial.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Native method throwing on unexpected input
function parseJsonString(jsonString: string) {
  // Assume jsonString is validated by Zod as a string
  // But what if an internal process passes an invalid JSON string?
  try {
    return JSON.parse(jsonString);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Failed to parse JSON:", e);
    // Handle gracefully, e.g., return a default object or null
    return null;
  }
}

parseJsonString('{"key": "value"}'); // Works
parseJsonString('invalid json'); // Throws SyntaxError, caught by try/catch`}/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe the notion that our internal code is immune to these issues is a misdirection. In my view, if a function, even deep
            within our application, can receive input that causes it to crash or behave unpredictably, it is ultimately
            our responsibility as developers to gracefully handle that input. I've found that a robust application anticipates and
            mitigates such scenarios. I've seen real-world examples, like a financial dashboard displaying incorrect calculations
            due to unhandled <code>NaN</code>s introduced during internal data processing, or an e-commerce platform
            failing to process orders because of missing object properties after complex data transformations, which vividly
            underscore this point. In my experience with such scenarios, failures stem not from initial external data validation, but from
            runtime data integrity issues within our application's core logic.</p>
        <h3 id="implementingRobustRuntime">Implementing Robust Runtime Checks (Beyond the Boundary)</h3>
        <p>I've realized that since TypeScript's static checks are removed at runtime, and initial validation only covers the entry point,
            consciously implementing robust runtime validation within our application becomes essential. In my development practice, this involves
            several practical approaches that I recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leveraging TypeScript's Type Guards and Assertion Functions:</strong> Within our TypeScript
                codebase, we can write custom <a
                        href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates"
                        target="_blank">type guards</a> or <a
                        href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#assertion-functions"
                        target="_blank">assertion functions</a> to perform runtime checks and inform
                the TypeScript compiler about a variable's type after the check. This allows us to combine dynamic
                runtime safety with static type inference. For example:
                <CodeBlock code={`
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}

function processInput(input: unknown) {
  if (isString(input)) {
    // TypeScript now knows 'input' is a string here
    console.log(input.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    console.error("Input was not a string!");
  }
}
`}/>
                Or better yet, use lodash which also accounts for new String().
                <CodeBlock code={`
function isString(value) {
    const type = typeof value;
    return (
        type === 'string' ||
        (type === 'object' &&
            value != null &&
            !Array.isArray(value) &&
            getTag(value) === '[object String]')
    );
}`}/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adopting Defensive Programming Patterns:</strong> Basic JavaScript checks remain powerful.
                Explicitly check for <code>typeof</code>, <code>instanceof</code>, <code>Array.isArray()</code>, <code>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()</code>,
                and other conditions directly within our functions, especially those that are critical, complex, or
                highly reused. This ensures that even if a value unexpectedly deviates from its expected type or
                structure, our code can handle it gracefully.
                <CodeBlock code={`
// Example: Processing a string defensively
function processUserName(name: string | null | undefined): string {
  if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.trim() === '') {
    console.warn("Invalid or empty user name provided. Using default.");
    return "Guest"; // Provide a safe default or throw a specific error
  }
  return name.trim().toUpperCase();
}

console.log(processUserName("  Alice  ")); // "ALICE"
console.log(processUserName(null));       // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(undefined));  // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(""));         // Warns, "Guest"
console.log(processUserName(123 as any)); // Warns, "Guest"`}/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="strategicValidation">Strategic Validation: Where and How Much?</h3>
        <p>I believe where we place runtime validation is crucial. While "entry point validation" — validating data as it first
            enters our application (e.g., at an API gateway, a serverless function handler, or a form submission
            endpoint) — is paramount, I've found it's not the only place to consider.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Boundaries:</strong> In my approach, this is the primary layer for comprehensive validation using
                schema libraries like Zod. Here, I ensure all external inputs meet our application's fundamental data
                contracts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Service or Business Logic Layers:</strong> I've observed that even after initial validation, data might be
                transformed or composed internally. I recommend that robust services or core business logic functions, especially those
                handling critical operations or consuming data from multiple internal sources, include internal
                defensive checks to ensure data integrity.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Utility Functions:</strong> As I've seen with lodash, generic utility functions benefit immensely
                from being highly defensive. I believe they should be resilient to a wide range of inputs, as they are often
                reused across many contexts and may receive data that has undergone various transformations or subtle
                coercions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key is balance. I validate thoroughly at the boundaries of untrusted data, but I also implement
            targeted, defensive checks within core logic and reusable components to ensure their robustness and
            predictable behavior.</p>
        <h3 id="testingForRuntimeEdgeCases">Testing for Runtime Edge Cases</h3>
        <p>This brings me to the crucial role of runtime testing. While I know TypeScript ensures our code adheres to its
            defined types during development, and Zod validates at the entry point, I believe tests are needed to verify how our
            code behaves when confronted with data that doesn't conform to those ideal types at runtime within our
            application's internal flow, or when it encounters other unexpected conditions.</p>
        <p>I like to consider how a robust utility library like lodash approaches this. For a function like <code>get(object,
            path, [defaultValue])</code>, which safely retrieves a value at a given <code>path</code> from
            <code>object</code>, I've noticed its tests don't just cover the "happy path" where <code>object</code> and
            <code>path</code> are perfectly valid. Instead, I've studied how lodash's extensive test suite includes scenarios where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>object</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, a number, a string, or a boolean,
                rather than an object, possibly due to a prior transformation.
            </li>
            <li><code>path</code> is an empty string, an array containing <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>
                elements, a non-existent path, or a path that leads to a non-object value where further traversal is
                attempted, even if the initial <code>object</code> was validated.
            </li>
            <li>The function is called with too few or too many arguments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've observed how these tests reveal how <code>get</code> gracefully handles various invalid inputs, typically returning <code>undefined</code>
            (or the specified <code>defaultValue</code>) rather than throwing an error or crashing the application. I consider this
            meticulous approach to testing for runtime resilience a hallmark of well-engineered code. In my experience, such runtime
            checks, combined with TypeScript's compile-time safety, create a layered defense against errors, ensuring
            our application remains stable even when confronted with imperfect data.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I've learned that relying solely on "entry point validation" isn't sufficient for complex applications if internal
            components are brittle. I believe unit tests that probe these edge cases ensure that individual "units" of code are
            resilient, regardless of where their data originates. I see libraries like lodash as prime examples of this
            philosophy, with extensive tests dedicated to covering every conceivable edge case for their utility
            functions.</p>
        <h3 id="typescriptsRoleConclusion">TypeScript's Role: A Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I've found that TypeScript is an invaluable asset for modern JavaScript development, providing strong type guarantees at
            build time that significantly reduce common programming errors. When I combine it with powerful runtime
            validation libraries like Zod, I create a formidable first line of defense. However, I've learned that this combination is
            not a silver bullet that eliminates the need for further runtime validation and comprehensive testing within
            our application's internal logic. In my experience, JavaScript's dynamic nature means that unexpected data and edge cases can
            still arise during execution, even with initially "safe" data.</p>
        <p>I believe true engineering involves understanding both the static safety provided by TypeScript and the dynamic
            realities of JavaScript. By embracing robust runtime checks—through TypeScript's type guards, defensive
            programming patterns, and strategic use of validation where data transformations occur—and rigorously
            testing for edge cases, I can build applications that are not only type-safe but also resilient, graceful,
            and truly robust in the face of real-world data. I've seen how this layered approach leads to improved user experience by
            preventing unexpected errors, easier debugging and maintenance due to predictable behavior, and ultimately,
            enhanced system reliability and security. For me, it's about building code that works reliably, even when the
            "unhappy path" presents itself within our own codebase.</p>
        <h2 id="waitYouStillUseLodash">Wait, You Still Use lodash?</h2>
        <p>Yes, and understanding why is key to understanding how I approach building with TypeScript. In an era where
            "You Might Not Need Lodash" is a common refrain and modern JavaScript has adopted many utility-like
            features, sticking with a library like lodash might seem anachronistic. However, my reliance on lodash,
            particularly functions like <code>get</code>, <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>isEqual</code>, and its collection
            manipulation utilities, stems from a deep appreciation for its battle-tested robustness and comprehensive
            handling of edge cases—qualities that are often underestimated or poorly replicated in custom
            implementations.</p>
        <h3 id="thePerilsOfRollingYourOwn">The Perils of "Rolling Your Own"</h3>
        <p>The argument that one can easily replicate lodash functions with a few lines of native JavaScript often
            overlooks the sheer number of edge cases and nuances that a library like lodash has been engineered to
            handle over years of widespread use. Consider a seemingly simple function like <code>get(object, path,
                defaultValue)</code>. A naive custom implementation might look something like this:</p>
        <CodeBlock code={`
function customGet(obj, path, defaultValue) {
  const keys = Array.isArray(path) ? path : path.split('.');
  let result = obj;
  for (const key of keys) {
    if (result && typeof result === 'object' && key in result) {
      result = result[key];
    } else {
      return defaultValue;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
`}/>
        <p>This custom <code>get</code> might work for straightforward cases. However, it quickly falls apart when faced
            with the myriad of scenarios lodash's <code>get</code> handles gracefully:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null or Undefined Objects/Paths:</strong> What if <code>obj</code> is <code>null</code> or
                <code>undefined</code>? What if <code>path</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, or an
                empty string/array? lodash handles these without throwing errors.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Object Values in Path:</strong> What if an intermediate key in the path points to a
                primitive value (e.g., <code>a.b.c</code> where <code>b</code> is a number)? Custom solutions often fail
                or throw errors.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Array Paths with Non-String Keys:</strong> lodash's <code>get</code> can handle paths like
                <code>['a', 0, 'b']</code> correctly.
            </li>
            <li><strong><code>__proto__</code> or <code>constructor</code> in Path:</strong> lodash specifically guards
                against prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> lodash functions are often highly optimized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As I talk about in, "<a href="/blog/your-lodash-get-implementation-sucks">You lodash.get implementation
            Sucks</a>," creating a truly robust equivalent to <code>get</code> that covers all these edge cases is a
            non-trivial
            task. Developers often underestimate this complexity, leading to buggy, unreliable utility functions that
            introduce subtle issues into their applications. The time and effort spent reinventing and debugging these
            wheels is rarely a good investment.</p>
        <h3 id="theEdgeCaseGauntlet">The Edge Case Gauntlet: Why lodash Wins</h3>
        <p><a href="https://utility.hello-a8f.workers.dev/#/" target="_blank">This vitest report</a> comparing lodash,
            es-toolkit, Remeda, and snippets from "You Might Not Need Lodash" provides compelling evidence of this. The
            report systematically tests various utility functions against a battery of edge cases. Time and again,
            lodash demonstrates superior coverage. While newer libraries or native JavaScript features might cover the
            "happy path" and some common edge cases, lodash consistently handles the more obscure, yet critical,
            scenarios that can lead to unexpected runtime failures.</p>
        <p>For example, consider <code>isEmpty</code>. It correctly identifies not just empty objects (<code>{}</code>),
            arrays (<code>[]</code>), and strings (<code>""</code>) as empty, but also <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>,
            <code>NaN</code>, empty <code>Map</code>s, empty <code>Set</code>s, and even
            <code>arguments</code> objects with no arguments. Replicating this breadth of coverage accurately is
            surprisingly difficult. Similarly,<code>isEqual</code> performs deep comparisons, handling circular
            references and comparing a wide variety of types correctly—a task notoriously difficult to implement
            flawlessly from scratch.</p>
        <h3 id="typescriptDoesntEliminateRuntime">TypeScript Doesn't Eliminate Runtime Realities</h3>
        <p>One might argue that TypeScript's static type checking reduces the need for such robust runtime handling.
            While TypeScript is invaluable, as discussed in the previous section, it doesn't eliminate runtime
            uncertainties. Data can still come from external APIs with unexpected shapes, undergo transformations that
            subtly alter its structure, or encounter JavaScript's own type coercion quirks.</p>
        <p>lodash functions act as a hardened layer of defense at runtime. They are designed with the understanding that
            JavaScript is dynamic and that data can be unpredictable. When I use <code>get(user, ['profile', 'street',
                'address.1'])</code>, I have 100% confidence that it will not throw an error if
            <code>user</code>, <code>profile</code>, or <code>address.1</code> is <code>null</code> or
            <code>undefined</code>, or if <code>street</code> doesn't exist. It will simply return undefined (or the
            provided default value), allowing my application to proceed gracefully. This predictability is immensely
            valuable.</p>
        <h3 id="focusingOnBusinessLogic">Focusing on Business Logic, Not Utility Plumbing</h3>
        <p>By relying on lodash, I can focus my development efforts on the unique business logic of my application,
            rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of writing and debugging low-level utility functions. The
            developers behind lodash have already invested thousands of hours into perfecting these utilities, testing
            them against countless scenarios, and optimizing them for performance. Leveraging their expertise is a
            pragmatic choice.</p>
        <p>While it's true that tree-shaking can mitigate the bundle size impact of including lodash (especially when
            importing individual functions like <code>import get from 'lodash/get'</code>), the primary benefit isn't
            just about
            bundle size; it's about reliability, developer productivity, and reducing the surface area for bugs.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, my continued use of lodash in a TypeScript world is a conscious decision rooted in a pragmatic
            approach to software engineering. It's about valuing battle-tested robustness, comprehensive edge-case
            handling, and the ability to focus on higher-level concerns, knowing that the foundational utility layer is
            solid and reliable. The cost of a poorly implemented custom utility is often far greater than the perceived
            overhead of using a well-established library.</p>
        <h2 id="unitTestingAndTdd">Unit Testing and TDD: Engineering for Reusability and Resilience</h2>
        <p>The principles discussed so far—the need for robust runtime checks even with TypeScript, and the value of
            battle-tested utilities like lodash—converge on a broader philosophy of software engineering: building for
            resilience and reusability. This naturally leads us to the indispensable practice of unit testing, and more
            specifically, Test-Driven Development (TDD).</p>
        <h3 id="theE2EFallacy">The E2E Fallacy: "If it Works, It's Good"</h3>
        <p>A common misconception, particularly in teams that prioritize rapid feature delivery, is that comprehensive
            End-to-End (E2E) tests are sufficient. The thinking goes: "If the user can click through the application and
            achieve their goal, then the underlying code must be working correctly." While E2E tests are crucial for
            validating user flows and integration points, relying on them solely is a shortcut that often signals a lack
            of deeper engineering discipline. This approach fundamentally misunderstands a key goal of good software:
            reusability.</p>
        <p>E2E tests primarily confirm that a specific pathway through the application behaves as expected at that
            moment. They do little to guarantee that the individual components, functions, or modules ("units") that
            make up that pathway are independently robust, correct across a range of inputs, or easily reusable in other
            contexts. Code that "just works" for E2E scenarios might be brittle, riddled with hidden dependencies, or
            prone to breaking when its internal logic is slightly perturbed or when it's leveraged elsewhere.</p>
        <h3 id="unitTestsForgingReusable">Unit Tests: Forging Reusable, Reliable Components</h3>
        <p>Unit testing forces us to think about code in terms of isolated, well-defined units with clear inputs and
            outputs. Each unit test verifies that a specific piece of code (a function, a method, a class) behaves
            correctly for a given set of inputs, including edge cases and invalid data. This is precisely the same
            discipline that makes libraries like lodash so valuable. lodash functions are reliable because they are, in
            essence, collections of extremely well-unit-tested pieces of code.</p>
        <p>Consider the arguments for using lodash even when data is validated at application boundaries: internal
            transformations can still introduce unexpected data, and JavaScript's dynamic nature can lead to subtle
            bugs. The same logic applies to our own code. A function that receives data, even if that data was validated
            by Zod at an API endpoint, might perform internal operations that could lead to errors if not handled
            correctly. Unit tests for that function ensure it is resilient to these internal variations and potential
            misuses.</p>
        <p>When we write unit tests, we are not just checking for correctness; we are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Designing for Testability:</strong> This often leads to better-designed code—more modular, with
                fewer side effects, and clearer interfaces. Code that is hard to unit test is often a sign of poor
                design.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Documenting Behavior:</strong> Unit tests serve as executable documentation, clearly
                demonstrating how a unit of code is intended to be used and how it behaves under various conditions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enabling Safe Refactoring:</strong> A comprehensive suite of unit tests gives us the confidence
                to refactor and improve code, knowing that if we break existing functionality, the tests will catch it
                immediately.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Isolating Failures:</strong> When a unit test fails, it points directly to the specific unit of
                code that has a problem, making debugging significantly faster and more efficient than trying to
                diagnose a failure in a complex E2E test.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="testDrivenDevelopment">Test-Driven Development (TDD): Building Quality In</h3>
        <p>Test-Driven Development takes this a step further by advocating writing tests before writing the
            implementation code. The TDD cycle is often summarized as "Red-Green-Refactor":</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Write a failing unit test that defines a small piece of desired functionality.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.</li>
            <li><strong>Refactor:</strong> Improve the code (e.g., for clarity, performance, removing duplication) while
                ensuring all tests still pass.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>TDD is not just a testing technique; it's a design methodology. By thinking about the requirements and edge
            cases from the perspective of a test first, we are forced to design our code with clarity, testability, and
            correctness in mind from the outset. It encourages building small, focused units of functionality that are
            inherently robust.</p>
        <h3 id="theCumulativeEffect">The Cumulative Effect: System Resilience</h3>
        <p>Just as a single, poorly implemented utility function can introduce subtle, cascading bugs throughout a
            system, a collection of well-unit-tested components contributes to overall system resilience. When
            individual units are known to be reliable across a wide range of inputs and edge cases, the likelihood of
            unexpected interactions and failures at a higher level decreases significantly.</p>
        <p>If a function is used in multiple places, and its behavior subtly changes or breaks due to an untested edge
            case, the impact can propagate throughout the application. This is where the "shortcut" of relying only on
            E2E tests becomes particularly dangerous. An E2E test might only cover one specific path through that
            function, leaving other usages vulnerable. Thorough unit testing, especially when guided by TDD, ensures
            that each unit is a solid building block, contributing to a more stable and maintainable system.</p>
        <p>The argument isn't to abandon E2E tests—they serve a vital purpose. Rather, it's to recognize that unit
            testing is a foundational engineering practice essential for building high-quality, reusable, and resilient
            software. It's about applying the same rigor to our own code that we expect from well-regarded libraries,
            ensuring that each piece, no matter how small, is engineered to be dependable. This disciplined approach is
            a hallmark of true software engineering, moving beyond simply making things "work" to making them work
            reliably and sustainably.</p>
        <h2 id="endToEndTesting">The Indispensable Role of End-to-End (E2E) Testing</h2>
        <p>While unit tests are foundational for ensuring the reliability and reusability of individual components,
            End-to-End (E2E) tests play a distinct, yet equally crucial, role in the software quality assurance
            spectrum. They are not a replacement for unit tests, by any stretch of the imagination, but rather a
            complementary practice that validates the application from a different, higher-level perspective.</p>
        <h3 id="e2eTestsValidating">E2E Tests: Validating the Entire User Journey</h3>
        <p>E2E tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. They interact with the application through its
            UI, just as a user would, clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating between pages, and verifying that
            the entire integrated system behaves as expected. This means they test the interplay between the frontend,
            backend services, databases, and any other external integrations.</p>
        <p>Their primary purpose is to answer the question: "Does the application, as a whole, meet the high-level
            business requirements and deliver the intended user experience?" If a user is supposed to be able to log in,
            add an item to their cart, and complete a purchase, an E2E test will automate this entire workflow to
            confirm its success.</p>
        <h3 id="whyE2ETestingIsImportant">Why E2E Testing is Important (But Not a Substitute for Unit Tests):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidence in Releases:</strong> Successful E2E test suites provide a high degree of confidence
                that the main user flows are working correctly before deploying new versions of the application. They
                act as a final safety net, catching integration issues that unit or integration tests (which test
                interactions between smaller groups of components) might miss.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing User Experience:</strong> E2E tests are the closest automated approximation to how a
                real user experiences the application. They can catch issues related to UI rendering, navigation, and
                overall workflow usability that are outside the scope of unit tests.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Verifying Critical Paths:</strong> They are particularly valuable for ensuring that the most
                critical paths and core functionalities of the application (e.g., user registration, checkout process,
                core data submission) are always operational.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="theHighLevelView">The High-Level View and the Overlooking of Unit Tests</h3>
        <p>The fact that E2E tests focus on these high-level requirements and observable user behavior might, in part,
            explain why the more granular and arguably more critical practice of unit testing is sometimes overlooked or
            undervalued. Stakeholders and even some developers might see a passing E2E test suite as sufficient proof
            that "everything works." This perspective is tempting because E2E tests often map directly to visible
            features and user stories.</p>
        <p>However, this overlooks the fundamental difference in purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>E2E tests</strong> verify that the assembled system meets external requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Unit tests</strong> verify that individual components are internally correct, robust, and
                reusable.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A system can have passing E2E tests for its main flows while still being composed of poorly designed,
            brittle, and non-reusable units. These underlying weaknesses might not surface until a minor change breaks
            an obscure part of a unit, or until an attempt is made to reuse a component in a new context, leading to
            unexpected bugs that are hard to trace because the E2E tests for the original flow might still pass.</p>
        <h3 id="theComplementaryNature">The Complementary Nature of Testing Layers</h3>
        <p>A robust testing strategy employs multiple layers, each with its own focus:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unit Tests:</strong> Form the base, ensuring individual building blocks are solid. They are
                fast, provide precise feedback, and facilitate refactoring.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integration Tests:</strong> Verify the interaction between groups of components or services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>End-to-End Tests:</strong> Sit at the top, validating complete user flows through the entire
                application stack.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>E2E tests are an essential final check, ensuring all the well-unit-tested and integrated parts come together
            to deliver the expected high-level functionality. They confirm that the user can successfully navigate and
            use the application to achieve their goals. But their strength in verifying the "big picture" should never
            be mistaken as a reason to neglect the meticulous, foundational work of unit testing, which is paramount for
            building a truly engineered, maintainable, and resilient software system.</p>
        <h2 id="eslint">ESLint: More Than Just Code Style – It's About Engineering Discipline</h2>
        <p>I've noticed a common misconception surrounding ESLint is that its primary, or even sole, purpose is to enforce basic code
            formatting and inconsequential stylistic opinions. While I know ESLint can be configured to manage code style via
            Prettier and other plugins, I believe its true power and core value lie significantly deeper: I see ESLint as a powerful
            static
            analysis tool designed to identify problematic patterns, potential bugs, and deviations from best practices
            directly in your code. For me, it's an automated guardian that helps uphold engineering discipline.</p>
        <h3 id="theMisconceptionESLint">The Misconception: ESLint as a Style Nanny</h3>
        <p>If your only interaction with ESLint has been to fix complaints about spacing, semicolons, or quote styles,
            I understand it's easy to dismiss it as a nitpicky style enforcer. In fact, I've learned that ESLint's core includes no stylistic rules at
            all.
            I think to see it only in this light is to miss its profound impact on code quality, maintainability, and
            robustness. In my experience, the most impactful ESLint configurations, especially for complex applications, leverage rules
            and plugins that have little to do with mere aesthetics and everything to do with preventing errors and
            promoting sound engineering.</p>
        <h3 id="theRealityESLint">The Reality: ESLint as a Powerful Bug Detector and Best Practice Enforcer</h3>
        <p>I've discovered that the real strength of ESLint emerges when it's augmented with specialized plugins that target specific areas
            of concern. Here are the ones I find most valuable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>@eslint/js</code> <strong>(ESLint's Recommended Rules):</strong> This foundational set
                catches a wide array of common JavaScript errors and logical mistakes, such as
                using variables before they are defined, unreachable code, or duplicate keys in object literals.
            </li>
            <li><code>@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin</code><strong>:</strong> Absolutely essential for TypeScript
                projects. This plugin allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax and apply rules that leverage
                TypeScript's type information. It can go far beyond what the TypeScript compiler (<code>tsc</code>)
                alone might enforce. They can flag potential runtime errors, misuse of promises (<code>no-floating-promises</code>,
                <code>no-misused-promises</code>), improper handling of <code>any</code> types, and enforce best
                practices for writing clear and safe TypeScript code.
            </li>
            <li><code>eslint-plugin-sonarjs</code><strong>:</strong> This plugin is laser-focused on detecting bugs and
                "code smells" – patterns that indicate deeper potential issues. Rules like
                <code>sonarjs/no-all-duplicated-branches</code> (which finds if/else chains where all branches are
                identical), <code>sonarjs/no-identical-expressions</code> (detects redundant comparisons), or <code>sonarjs/no-element-overwrite</code>
                (prevents accidentally overwriting array elements) help catch subtle logical flaws that might otherwise
                slip into production.
            </li>
            <li><code>eslint-plugin-unicorn</code><strong>:</strong> While some of its rules are indeed stylistic or
                highly opinionated, many others in the recommended set promote writing more modern, readable, and
                robust JavaScript. For example, rules like <code>unicorn/no-unsafe-regex</code> help prevent regular
                expressions that could lead to ReDoS attacks, <code>unicorn/throw-new-error</code> enforces using new
                with Error objects, and <code>unicorn/prefer-modern-dom-apis</code> encourages the use of newer, safer
                DOM APIs. The goal is often to guide developers towards clearer and less error-prone patterns.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Specialized Plugins:</strong> The ESLint ecosystem is vast. Other plugins used in <a
                    href="https://github.com/eglove/ethang-monorepo/tree/master/packages/eslint-config/src"
                    target="_blank">my own config</a> includes <code>@html-eslint/eslint-plugin</code>,
                <code>jsx-a11y</code>, <code>eslint-plugin-lodash</code>, <code>eslint-plugin-perfectionist</code>,
                <code>@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query</code>, <code>@eslint/css</code>, <code>@eslint/json</code>, <code>eslint-plugin-compat</code>,
                <code>@tanstack/eslint-plugin-router</code>, <code>@cspell/eslint-plugin</code>, and others specific to
                Angular, Astro, React, Solid, and StoryBook.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="aConfigExample">A Config Example: Engineering Intent</h3>
        <p>A well-curated ESLint configuration, such as the one <a
                href="https://github.com/eglove/ethang-monorepo/tree/master/packages/eslint-config/src"
                target="_blank">I've developed</a>, is a testament to an intentional approach to software quality. By
            carefully selecting and configuring plugins for TypeScript, SonarJS, Unicorn, security, and more, and by
            opting for strict rule sets, I've embedded engineering best practices directly into the development
            workflow. This isn't about arbitrary style choices; it's about a deliberate effort to minimize bugs, improve
            code clarity, and ensure long-term maintainability.</p>
        <h3 id="eslintsRole">ESLint's Role in the Engineering Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>Integrating ESLint deeply into the development process provides several key benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated First Line of Defense:</strong> ESLint catches many common errors and bad practices
                automatically, often directly in the IDE, before code is even committed or reviewed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enforcing Consistency:</strong> It ensures that all code contributed to a project adheres to a
                consistent set of quality standards, which is invaluable for team collaboration and onboarding new
                developers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Cognitive Load in Reviews:</strong> By automating the detection of many common issues,
                ESLint allows code reviewers to focus their attention on more complex aspects of the code, such as the
                business logic, architectural design, and algorithmic efficiency.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proactive Improvement:</strong> ESLint rules can guide developers towards better coding habits
                and introduce them to new language features or patterns that improve code quality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusionESLint">Conclusion: ESLint as a Pillar of Quality</h3>
        <p>I believe ESLint, when wielded effectively, transcends its reputation as a mere style checker. In my development practice, it becomes a critical
            component of a robust software engineering approach. By automatically enforcing rules that target bug
            prevention, code clarity, security, and best practices, I've seen how ESLint helps teams build software that is not just
            functional but also more reliable, maintainable, and secure. I consider it a proactive tool that fosters a culture of
            quality and discipline, contributing significantly to the overall health and longevity of a codebase.</p>
